          "context": "   R  -V-  NICOLA EDGINGTON   CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT  4 MARCH 2013  SENTENCING REMARKS OF HIS HONOUR JUDGE BRIAN BARKER Q.C.  RECORDER OF LONDON               The professionals who have examined you over the years have revealed a troubled and difficult history.  During the trial we have reviewed the findings in considerable detail. The central aspects I must re visit.  On November 4th 2005, aged 25, at the invitation of your mother,  you returned from London to Forrest Row.  Having spent some of the evening with your brother you returned to her home where she was living alone.  There had been a running dispute as to the welfare of your young children and within a short time of arriving you stabbed her to death with a large kitchen knife.  You were remanded to HMP Bronzefield and then  unsurprisingly spent some months being assessed at the Bracton Centre prior to sentence.  You were diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia with a prominent mood component at the time of the killing, and your plea of diminished  responsibility was accepted at the Lewes Crown Court on October 23rd 2006.  Orders  were made under s.37 & 41 of the Mental Health Act 1983.  No further signs were  detected and your treatment with anti-psychotic and mood stabilising medication  continued.  It is clear from the evidence that we have heard that you were considered a suitable  candidate for a return to the community within a comparatively short time and by  January 2009 a discharge plan had been drawn up.  In September 2009, with the  concurrence of all including the MoJ, you were conditionally discharged.  Your medication was to continue, you lived in approved accommodation and you had regular meetings with the consultant psychiatrist, your community psychiatric nurse and the forensic social worker.  It is quite clear that you had considerable support and understanding throughout this period.    You travelled to Jamaica twice in connection with your children and in early 2011 became pregnant, and by agreement the taking of sodium valporate ceased.  After a                         1                           miscarriage you obtained a part-time job and at the end of September you contacted  your brother on Facebook.  It is perhaps no surprise that this attempt was greeted with less than enthusiasm.  Two years have now gone by since the discharge, and on Friday October 7th you reported sick to your employers and a relapse of some sort occurred over the following weekend.  By Sunday evening you were calling the police complaining about crackheads in your flat  and on 03.30 Monday morning you were in a cab making some attempt to get to hospital  for treatment.  You were taken back to the cab office and the employees were sufficiently  alarmed by your behaviour and requests to go to hospital, that they called the police.   Local officers arrived, assessed the situation and promptly took you to the busy A&E of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital.  There they waited with you and once you had registered  at 04.45 they returned to their duties.    It is apparent that you were attempting to contact the Bracton Centre and your carers on  your mobile but had no success.  Your demeanour and aggression was clearly a cause of  concern.  Within 30 minutes you were seen by the triage nurse and arrangements were made to transfer you to the adjoining psychiatric unit Oxleas House.  Meanwhile you had made a number of 999 calls indicating that you were dangerous, were having a  breakdown; that you were being ignored, had done a murder before and could end up hurting someone if the police did not come.    You were assessed at 05.30 by a nurse from Oxleas, your records were obtained and after   being escorted over you arrived at the Centre at 06.40. You, at your own request, were left in an internal garden area to smoke.  The plan was to admit you and records were investigated.  Dr Idowu, the Senior House Officer, told us  that as became more aware of your complex history and the conviction , his view was that you needed further investigation, to be detained if necessary  and that you were a  possible danger.  You then decided to leave the closed unit, and where you had asked to be.  You said later that  ‘they were just tapping keyboards, I told them I was going to hurt someone, this all  their fault.’   It was unfortunate that at this time the shift was changing, and one of the doors was apparently faulty.  You remained briefly in reception before walking through and out onto the street.  Once the staff realised this, Dr Idowa was notified and he immediately dialled 999 and notified the police of his concern.    Much of the rest of the story in captured by one CCTV camera or another.  You can be  seen boarding a bus outside the unit with your freedom card, changing at Kidbrook Station and journeying on to Bexley Heath Town Centre.  No unusual behaviour is  noticeable on the two buses and you continue to make calls.  At 08.13 you got off and  within minutes entered Asda.  You can be seen making enquiries, selecting a large kitchen knife and paying at a self-service till.  You entered the ladies’ toilet and discarded    the wrappings.  You left the store, walked to a nearby bus stop and immediately attacked   Kerry Clark with an overarm blow aimed at her chest.  She was a complete stranger and  listening to music while waiting for her bus.  Fortunately she reacted with speed and  bravery and grasped the blade with both hands.  Your aggression forced her to the  ground but she managed to retain the knife and kick you off.  You demanded the knife back before slipping off as members of the public began to assess and react.  A number of  observers called the police including Mr Nicholas Morris who followed you and was able  to give the police a running commentary and later warn a passer-by of impending danger                                                2                                 Having gone over the road, you entered a butcher’s shop and while the employee’s back  was turned stole his large working knife.  You set off towards the Bowling Alley, crossing a major junction in doing so.    Mrs Sally Hodkin, another complete stranger, had changed her usual route to work and was walking into the town centre.  You went directly to her, attacked her violently without pause and left her on the grass.  She suffered a number of incised wounds,  delivered with severe force to her neck and head.  In the view of the pathologist, Mrs Hodkin’s death was swift.  You then went to the shops at the junction, telling the shopkeeper that you thought you  had hurt someone and killed them.  By this time officers, directed by Mr Morris, were arriving and you were arrested.  You made further limited admissions and after being  taken back to the QEH for an injury to be to be dressed, you were booked in to Lewisham   Police Station.  Professionals there took the view that your condition was deteriorating  and you were later seen by medical staff who had arrived from the from the Bracton Centre .  It may well be that both before and after you were experiencing some form of   transient psychosis.  You were charged in the early hours of the next morning and on   October 12th you were transferred to Russet Ward at Ealing Hospital where you remained until trial.  You have subsequently claimed complete amnesia.   The psychiatrists that subsequently examined you accept that you were suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning, but disagreed as to what it was.  The jury concluded on all the evidence that any such abnormality did not substantially impair your ability to  form a rational judgment or to exercise self-control during the crucial period and did not provide an explanation for the crucial conduct.  In Russet Ward you continued to receive anti psychotic medication but showed no signs of psychosis.  What the records show is aggression, intimidation, disruption, anger and emotionally instability particularly when your demands were not being met, and a  regular feature was blaming everyone else for your situation.  Dr Joseph’s view is that  early and continuing diagnosis after your mother’s death of paranoid schizophrenia is  understandable, but when your behaviour after your arrest for these matters is added to the overall picture the dominant characteristic above your mental health difficulties is a  borderline personality disorder with the ability to form rational judgment.  However we look at things, both before and after, your actions from deciding to leave the   security of the Oxleas Unit to the stabbing of Mrs Hodkin were a consistent and  calculated course of criminal conduct.  What I conclude from the full spectrum is that you are manipulative and exceptionally dangerous  I am moved by the words of Mr Hodkin and his family describing the personal suffering  arising out the death of Mrs Hodkin. Everyone in the family and his friends from that  moment on has been struggling to understand their loss, and the fact that she has gone for ever.  Nothing that we can do, or say, can turn back the clock, and while over time  Mrs Hodkin’s  family and friends may get used to her death, they will never get over it,  and she will not be forgotten.  I have not been asked for pre-sentence reports and I note the recent medical report indicating that there is no need for hospital treatment. I have listened carefully to what                                3                            has been said helpfully on your behalf by Mr Cooper.  In particular he submits that you had a significant condition and at the time that you were a woman in crisis trying to comply with directions in the care plan.  He submits that there was little premeditation and it should be relevant that she was not given the help that she was seeking due to failure by the various authorities.  In addition  he submits that the court should adopt a 25 year start time for the murder and that there are mitigating features in relation to the attempted murder.  I disagree that responsibility for these acts can be laid at the door of others. You made a choice and the fact is these were terrible acts, and you must take  responsibility for what you did.  I cannot ignore the fact that you have killed before and that overall you have come as near as can be to having three deaths at your hands.   The penalty for murder is mandatory; it is life imprisonment.  Parliament in 2003 set out  the procedure.    I have to determine the minimum term that you must serve before you may be considered for release on licence. Looking at the overall circumstances, although in accordance with the amended schedule 21 of the CJA 2003 the starting point in this case could be one of 25 years, in my view this offence falls within paragraph 5 namely ‘particularly high’ despite not  being  one of the non-exhaustive examples; and thus in my judgment  the appropriate start point is 30 years.  I next have to consider whether there are any aggravating or mitigating features which  might increase or decrease the minimum term to be specified    There are a number of aggravating features including premeditation, and a  determination to overcome failure in order  to achieve your ends. Additionally,  the fact that you obtained two knives for only one conceivable reason and the fact that you chose the ideal location to rearm yourself.  These attacks were unprovoked and random   The main mitigating feature is that you suffer from a mental disability,  but on the particular facts of this case there is no convincing case to conclude that the abnormality reduced your culpability to any significant extent.  I have been referred to various  authorities with regard to sentence, although each turns very much on their own facts.  In addition you have been found guilty of attempting to kill Kerry Clark.  The fact that   you failed was only due to good fortune and swift reaction.  I have a variety of sentencing options in relation to this offence.  In view of the more  serious conviction,   I intend to treat that offence as an aggravating feature and reflect it  in an increase to the minimum to be served in the life sentence   In my view the cumulative features means that I have to raise the minimum term.  What you did could not have been more selfish.  The Hodkin family have lost a loved and  central member; meanwhile Kerry Clark is lucky to be alive and has had to wrestle with the disruption and long term turmoil that your actions generated. For all that you have to  take responsibility.  Taking all factors into account the minimum period of your life imprisonment term will  be one of 37 years.                               4                     For the attempted murder I have concluded that you represent a significant risk to the public under s.225 and that a life sentence is appropriate.  I have considered the  guidelines.  A period of 20 years is the notional determinate term.  I am required to take into account the days served and reduce the appropriate figure by half.  The exact sentence will be calculated.   On the information I have the period for each of you is 510 days But if this period is mistaken this court will order an amendment of the record for the  correct period to be recorded   The law says this means that it is only after you have served the minimum period for  count two, the murder of Mrs Hodkin; that will then be eligible for consideration for release by the Parole Board in their discretion.   If and when released you will be on licence for the rest of your life.   I wish to acknowledge the patience, dignity and suffering of the Hodgkin family and Kerry Clark and hope that they will be able to move forward, at least to some extent, in their lives  I also wish to pay particular tribute to Nicholas Morris.  By following and commenting he  ignored his own safety and demonstrated public spiritedness of the highest order.  I would hope that senior officers would be able to recognise his actions in some appropriate way.   I also wish to acknowledge the actions of all officers who responded during the course of   these unhappy and difficult events, and the investigating officers for their extensive preparations.  Finally my thanks to all counsel for their help, and to those jurors who have returned my thanks again for your service to the Court and to the community.     HH Judge Brian Barker Q.C.

          "context": " Derby Crown Court R -v- Ihjaz Ali, Razwan Javed and Kabir Ahmed  Sentencing Remarks of HHJ Burgess  10 February 2012   Over 60 million people live in the United Kingdom. More than 51 million of us live in England. Our population is made up of people of all colours, creeds and cultures. For the vast majority of the time the vast majority of us get along together very well, and the greatest freedom that we all enjoy is to live in peace and without fear. The law has evolved and adapted to protect that freedom. In particular, laws have been passed to prevent written material being distributed which is intended to stir up hatred. This has proved necessary because a small minority of our broad community sometimes seeks to stir up hatred against their fellow citizens merely because those fellow citizens are perceived to be different in some way. In 1986 the Public Order Act made it an offence to distribute threatening, abusive or insulting written material with intent to stir up Racial Hatred. In 2006 the legislation was extended to prevent the stirring up of hatred on religious grounds.  Most recently the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 again extended the area of protection. It was clearly perceived by parliament that people of a particular sexual orientation needed protection from that minority who wished to stir up hatred against them. This happens to be the first prosecution under that legislation. 1        Much has been said during the course of the trial about freedom of expression, and the  freedom to preach strongly held beliefs; beliefs, which may have some foundation in scripture. Freedom of speech is a cornerstone of democracy and a basic ingredient of any free society. Parliament clearly had this very much in mind when this legislation was passed, and it may be helpful if we remind ourselves of the specifics of the offences of which you have been convicted. The charge was one of distributing written material which was threatening with intent to stir up hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation. Parliament, clearly considering the issue of freedom of speech, added that discussion or criticism of sexual conduct or practices or the urging of people to refrain from or modify such behaviour shall not be taken of itself to be threatening or intended to stir up hatred. There was no intention to stifle debate, merely to protect. The Jury had the benefit of listening to all of the evidence in this case. They knew what the constituents of the offence were, and they had well in mind that the offence would not be committed by mere adverse criticism of homosexuality. Their convictions can only have been on the basis that the document that all three of you were distributing was threatening, and that by distributing it you all intended to stir up hatred against homosexuals. The leaflet depicted a mannequin swinging from a hangman’s noose, under the caption of “Death Penalty?”  Next to that was the information that in 1533 Buggery was punished by hanging. On the other side was text which said among other things that the only debate among classical authorities about how to punish homosexuality was the method of carrying out the execution: burning, flinging from some high place or stoning. It said that the death sentence was the only way that the immoral crime (of homosexuality)can be erased from corrupting society”.         2 In the course of evidence we heard what effect, reading that leaflet had upon four homosexual men. All felt threatened. The background to the distribution of these leaflets outside the mosque after Friday Prayers and through letter-boxes on residential streets is worth mentioning, because it gives some idea of the hostility felt by you defendants and the level of organisation.  The Derby Gay Pride march was to take place on 10th July 2010. You Ihjaz Ali took on the role of organising a campaign to counter this march, and on the day of the march, you, Kabir Ahmed and 12 others staged a small counter demonstration. No criminal charges arose as a result of that demonstration. I only mention it because the Gay Pride March was the focus of your activity, and because the very small number who attended your demonstration gives a good indication that the vast majority of the Muslim community did not want to be associated with what you were doing. In the lead up to that day, what I am sure were hundreds of anti-gay leaflets were distributed. The first two were not the subject of charges, but they do provide the context of these offences. They may not have been “threatening”, but most people would regard them as offensive at the very least. “G.A.Y. God Abhors You” and “Turn or Burn” also distributed them. You, Ihjaz Ali, organised the distribution of those leaflets, and you, Kabir Ahmed, There were complaints to the Police about them. You, Ihjaz Ali were subsequently made aware of those complaints. That knowledge did not stop you continuing to distribute the leaflet that is the subject of the charge. You, Kabir Ahmed and you Razwan Javed, both distributed the Death Penalty leaflet outside the Mosque at Friday prayers on 2nd July 2010. You Ihjaz Ali had provided them with the leaflets. You also provided the other two defendants with the leaflets that they distributed on 4th July. It would be wrong for anyone to suggest that Ahmed and Razwan Javed were acting as little more than postmen. There was evidence on the papers to support the contention that you intended to stir up hatred. You, Razwan Javed had been making      3 internet searches on topics relevant to the content of the leaflets and you, Kabir Ahmed made a video which you posted on You-tube, containing the slogan: Gay today- Paedo tomorrow. You8 were also found to have quantities of the leaflets at your home when you were arrested. It is right to say that you, Ihjaz Ali had contact with the Police, and discussed a number of matters with the Community Officer. This was largely to do with the Organisation of the protest, and it is significant that the Police were never consulted about the content of the 3 leaflets the Jury had to consider. Given that this is the first prosecution of its type, there are no guidelines and no guideline cases. Accordingly, I have reminded myself of general principles as set down in sections 142 and 143 of the CJA 2003. I have borne in mind that one of the purposes of sentencing is the reduction of crime (including its reduction by  deterrence). I have borne in mind that, when considering the seriousness of these offences I have to consider not only the culpability of the offender, but also the harm that was caused, or was intended to be caused, or might foreseeably have been caused. Here, I am obviously keen to dissuade anyone from distributing this sort of material in the future. Looking at the harm done, I have considered the threat felt by the individuals that gave evidence at the trial, and the likelihood that others were similarly affected.  I have borne in mind that the residents of the streets who received this leaflet do not seem to have changed their attitude or behaviour towards their gay neighbours. Indeed it was heartening to hear one witness say that he experienced great support from his neighbours following the distribution of these leaflets. That said, you have been convicted of intending to stir up hatred. It follows that your intention was to do great harm in a peaceful community.          4 It is also heartening that there have been no similar offences since your arrest. No-one seems to have been tempted to copy you. However, it is hard to ascertain exactly how much harm you have caused by distributing this leaflet outside the Mosque. I have considered a number of cases supplied to me by Miss Cheema. They are of general interest, but none of them is factually similar, and in a number of instances, the charges relating to volatile material are secondary offences, and the sentencing Judge has had to consider totality. I have also borne in mind the case of R v Sheppard and Whittle (2010 2 Cr. App. R (S) 68) which relates to Racist material on the internet. Again it is not factually similar to this case, but the Court of Appeal did say that they regarded the need to deter others as being an important element of sentencing in cases of this kind. In mitigation I bear in mind your good character. I have considered the personal references that speak highly of you, the contribution to society that you make and are capable of making. I have read expressions of remorse from each of you. They would have carried far more weight had you pleaded guilty and acknowledged your culpability, but it may be the case that you do now recognise the fact that what you did was wrong. I am also conscious of the fact that these offences were committed in July 2010 and that none of you have offended since, or done anything to aggravate the situation. Nevertheless these offences have to be marked by a Prison sentence, for all the reasons I have already given. In your case Ihjaz Ali, of all the people that were in the dock, you were clearly the main organiser. You distributed the leaflets to others who in turn delivered them. I have to deal with you for all four counts on the indictment. The sentence in your case is 2 years on each count concurrently. Razwan  Javed and Kabir Ahmed, I cannot make a distinction between you. As I have already explained there is evidence that you were more involved than just acting as passive distributors.       5 The sentence in each of your cases is 15 months. That means each of you will serve up to half you sentence inside prison. The balance will be served on licence. There may be requirements of that licence. Should you fail to comply with those requirements or should you commit another offence during the licence period, you are like to be recalled to serve some or all of the balance of your       sentence.  6 ",

          "context": "  THE HON MR JUSTICE HOLROYDE A PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE NORTHERN CIRCUIT    IN THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT   T1992 0238   THE QUEEN -v- ASIL NADIR SENTENCING REMARKS 23 AUGUST 2012        Asil  Nadir,  you  are  a  man  of  outstanding  business  skills,  and  in  the  1980s  you achieved remarkable success.  In a decade you developed Polly Peck International plc into  a  multi-national  business.    You  no  doubt  brought  employment  and  financial benefit to many persons around the world.  You are entitled to take great pride in that achievement.    The  company’s  success  was  in  many  ways  your  success.    But  the company’s  money  was  not  your  money.    You  knew  that.    You  nonetheless  helped yourself to it.  You committed theft on a grand scale.   You have been convicted of 10 offences of theft.  The first involved the theft by you of £5,150,000 on 14th August 1987 – 25 years ago last week.  The last involved the theft of another £5 million three years later, on 6th August 1990.  In all, during that three-year period, you stole from PPI sums totalling £28.6 million, and US$500,000 with a sterling  equivalent  at  the  time  of  nearly  £300,000.    Without  making  any  detailed analysis of changes in the value of money over the intervening years, it is fair to say that the total sum stolen equates to more than £60 million today.   You committed those thefts by authorising or instructing the transfer of monies out of PPI’s bank accounts in London.  The monies were then moved through various other bank  accounts,  in  particular  a  bank  account  of  a  PPI  subsidiary  company  known  as    the Unipac Jersey account, to end uses which were nothing to do with PPI’s business but were instead for the benefit of you, your family and associates.  The flow charts which  were  provided  to  the  jury  showed  the  complex  routes  which  the  money  took before reaching those end uses.  That complexity was intended by you, and designed, to  obscure  and  conceal  the  reality  of  what  you  were  doing.    The  transactions  were accounted  for  in  the  books  and  records  of  PPI  in  such  a  way  that  it  appeared  that funds  were  legitimately  being  transferred,  for  company  purposes,  to  subsidiary companies  in  northern  Cyprus  and  Turkey.    The  reality  was  that  you  were  stealing from the company.     It is relevant to give some brief examples of the end uses to which the stolen money was  applied.    It  was  used  to  buy  shares  in  PPI,  both  in  your  own  name  and  in  the names of others who were clearly your nominees and controlled by you.   It was used to  acquire  or  fund  various  businesses  and  properties  from  which  you  benefited.    It was used to pay your personal expenditure, including a tax bill of over £1 million.   On one  occasion,  stolen  money  was  even  used  to  make  a  donation  to  charity  in  your name.  The fact that stolen money was used to fund an extravagant lifestyle can often be  a  very  significant  aggravating  feature  in  cases  of  theft.  I  do  not  regard  it  as counting  particularly  heavily  against  you  here,  because  it  seems  to  me  that  you already had an extravagant lifestyle as a result of your success in business.  It follows, however, that you were a wealthy man who stole out of pure greed.  The direct consequence of your crimes was that the company suffered the loss of just under £29 million.  But that was not the only consequence.  In the late summer and autumn  of  1990,  the  bankers  who  had  previously  been  glad  to  lend  money  to  PPI began  to  seek  repayment  of  short-term  loans  as  they  fell  due.    There  was  then  an urgent need for cash to be remitted from the near east subsidiary companies to PPI head  office  in  London  so  that  the  most  pressing  demands  could  be  met  and  the confidence  of  the  lending  banks  restored.    But  nothing  was  remitted.    You  gave  a series  of  assurances  to  your  fellow  directors  and  to  the  banks  as  to  particular  sums being  available  by  particular  dates.    None  of  those  assurances  was  kept.    No  money was  made  available.    After  a  time,  the  banks  –  unsurprisingly  -  would  no  longer accept  your  talk  of  money  arriving  shortly.    One  bank  pressed  particularly  hard  for repayment  of  a  comparatively  small  loan.    You  were  told  of  that  demand  for Page 2 of 9 repayment,  and  promised  in  a  telephone  call  that  you  would  fix  it.    The  evidence makes  me  sure  that  you  fixed  it  by  arranging  for  one  of  your  assistants  to  forge  a letter  which  purported  to  be  confirmation  from  a  bank  that  the  necessary  funds would be remitted.  That was not the only document which was falsified by those who were  assisting  you  in  northern  Cyprus,  and  again  the  evidence  makes  me  sure  that your hand was behind the various forgeries and other false accounting records which were used to conceal the thefts of which you have been convicted.     Your  fellow  directors  decided,  entirely  understandably,  that  there  was  no  realistic option open to them other than to petition for PPI to be placed into administration. In  your  evidence  to  the  jury  you  unjustly  accused  those  directors  of  having  been intimidated by legal advice as to their prospective personal liabilities if PPI continued trading  whilst  insolvent.    You  further  accused  many  others  of  incompetence,  wrong doing and malice.  You blamed everyone but yourself for the collapse of PPI.  I accept that there may well have been many complex factors which collectively brought about that  collapse,  and  I  agree  with  Mr  Hackett  that  it  would  be  wrong  to  say  that  you alone  were  responsible  for  it.    However,  the  evidence  makes  me  sure  that  one substantial cause of the collapse was the failure of the near east subsidiaries to remit any cash when it was so urgently needed.  If all the money was where it should have been, and if there was nothing to hide, then the failure to send any of it from northern Cyprus  to  London  was  inexplicable.  Whatever  concerns  the  directors  of  those subsidiaries may have had as to their future, the evidence makes it entirely clear that they  would  obey  your  direct  instructions.  But  of  course  the  money  which  you  had stolen  was  not  where  it  should  have  been,  and  so  you  did  have  something  to  hide.  The evidence I have heard therefore drives me to the conclusion that you, having on ten  occasions  stolen  PPI’s  money,  were  determined  to  frustrate  any  meaningful investigation of the finances of the near east subsidiaries which would have revealed those  thefts.  I  am  sure  that  for  that  reason  you  were  responsible  for  the  failure  to remit  funds.  You  blame  others  for  the  collapse  of  PPI,  but  the  evidence  makes  me sure that your conduct in committing those ten thefts, and in seeking to cover them up, was at least one of the substantial causes of it.  With that collapse, of course, came financial loss to all who had invested in PPI: not just large institutional investors, but private investors and persons whose pension funds were partly invested in PPI shares.     Page 3 of 9 You  were  arrested  and  charged.  After  lengthy  preparation,  your  trial  was  set  for September 1993.  You did not remain in this country to stand trial.  Instead, in May 1993,  you  fled  to  northern  Cyprus.    No  doubt  you  had  been  under  very  great  stress and pressure in the period before your departure, and I accept that for at least a short time your health suffered as a result; but you had brought the stress of criminal and civil proceedings upon yourself by your thefts from PPI.    Mr Hackett asks me to have regard to what were on any view extraordinary events in the proceedings around that time, which he submits would have shaken the confidence of anyone in your position.  I am not persuaded by that point; but even if I were, it does not begin to explain your then staying in northern Cyprus.  You remained absent from this country for 17 years, and so delayed for nearly two decades the day of reckoning which has finally arrived.     It  is  important  that  I  should  make  clear  to  you  and  to  the  public  the  sentencing principles which I have applied.   First,  the  jury  heard  evidence  about  many  transfers  of  money  which  were  not  the subject of counts in the indictment.  Although that evidence was properly considered by them, the law provides that the court can sentence only for the specific offences of which you have been convicted.  I make it plain that is what I will do.   Next, the approach the court must take in sentencing for crimes committed long ago has been indicated by the Court of Appeal in the recent case of R v H & Others [2012] 1  WLR  1416.    I  must  apply  current  statutory  provisions.    You  therefore  gain  the benefit  of  a  statutory  amendment  which  has  come  into  force  since  you  committed your crimes, the effect of which is that the maximum sentence for any one offence is now 7 years imprisonment even though it was 10 years at the time when the offences were committed.   I must have regard to the purposes of sentencing set out in section 142  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003,  and  by  section  143  of  that  Act  I  must  have regard to the seriousness of the offences, taking into account your culpability and the harm which your offending caused.   Next,  I  must  also  have  regard  to  the  sentencing  guidelines  which  are  now  in  force, notwithstanding  that  they  did  not  exist  when  the  offences  were  committed.    The relevant guideline is that applicable to offences of theft committed in breach of trust.  Page 4 of 9      It indicates a starting point of 3 years’ imprisonment, and a range of 2 to 6 years, for a man  of  previous  good  character  convicted  after  trial  of  a  single  offence  of  theft  of  a sum  of  £125,000  or  more.  You,  of  course,  have  been  convicted  of  ten  offences, involving far larger sums.   In  assessing  the  seriousness  of  your  offences,  I  regard  the  following  as  aggravating features. First,  the  combination  of  your  breach  of  the  trust  reposed  in  you  by  your  fellow directors, and your abuse of your position of authority and control over PPI in general and the near east subsidiaries in particular.  It is true that you were but one director in a board of directors; but the evidence in this trial has shown very clearly that you were a dominant figure, especially so in relation to anything to do with the near east subsidiaries.  You were in a position to use that dominance for good or for ill.  You chose to use it in ways which enabled you to commit theft.  A particular example of that  is  your  determined  retention  of  your  sole  signatory  status  in  respect  of  the Unipac Jersey account, a status which you cynically exploited by using that account to disguise what was really happening to the funds which had left PPI. Secondly, the number of your offences and the extent of the loss which you caused.    Thirdly,  your  persistence  in  stealing  over  a  period  of  time.  In  this  regard,  I  take particular note of the evidence that in October 1989 you were spoken to by one of the company’s  auditors,  who  had  cause  to  question  a  particular  transaction.  You  gave him an untruthful explanation, which concealed what had really happened. Even on that  basis,  he  advised  you  that  what  you  had  done  was  extremely  unwise.  You  were not deterred by that warning.  You went on to commit three further offences. Fourthly, the sophistication of the manner in which the thefts were committed, and your  concealment  of  your  crimes  by  causing  others  to  make  false  entries  in  the company’s  books  and  records.    You  were  assisted  by  a  number  of  persons  in  this country and abroad: each of them was an employee of PPI or of a company which had been set up to manage your personal wealth, and in that way you exploited the fact that you were in effective charge of both companies.   Page 5 of 9       As  to  matters  of  mitigation,  I  take  into  account  the  following  points  which individually and collectively enable me to reduce to some extent the sentences which would otherwise be appropriate. First, your previous good character.  Allied to that, I accept Mr Hackett’s submission that the court can be confident you will not reoffend.   Secondly,  your  central  role  in  the  successful  development  of  PPI  and  the  benefits  it brought to many employees and investors before its collapse. Thirdly,  and  importantly,  your  voluntary  return  to  this  country.    The  jury’s  verdicts establish  that  you  did  not  return  because  you  were  an  innocent  man  who  had  been the  victim  of  injustice.    But  whatever  its  true  motivation  may  have  been,  that voluntary return enabled the trial to proceed.   Fourthly,  the  fact  that  having  returned  the  conditions  of  your  bail  required  you  to observe  a  nightly  curfew  which  continued  for  nearly  two  years.    Although  not qualifying  by  statute  for  a  specific  reduction  in  your  sentence,  I  accept  that  it constituted a significant restraint upon your liberty which I should take into account.  I similarly take into account the short periods which you spent in police custody.   Fifthly,  your  current  state  of  health.    I  have  at  an  earlier  stage  of  these  proceedings received medical evidence, in particular the reports of two consultant cardiologists.   I am aware that you underwent a medical procedure in 2005, and that your condition requires  medication  and  regular  monitoring.   It  appears  however  that  your cardiovascular condition is stable under this medication, and has not worsened since 2005.    You  must  understand  that  in  the  ordinary  way,  the  ill  health  of  a  person sentenced  to  imprisonment  is  a  matter  for  the  prison  authorities,  not  a  reason  to reduce what would otherwise be the appropriate sentence. As Mr Hackett realistically accepts, the evidence I have heard as to your state of health does not indicate that it is so  poor  as  to  render  imprisonment  unusually  difficult  or  onerous  in  your  case.  I nonetheless  think  it  appropriate  to  take  your  poor  health  into  account  when considering your voluntary return to this country: it provided another reason why you Page 6 of 9 might  have  chosen  to  remain  in  the  near  east,  and  it  is  to  your  credit  that  you nonetheless returned.   In  a  similar  way,  I  take  into  account  your  age  as  another  factor  relevant  to  your voluntary return.  You were aged 69 at that time, which was another reason why you might have chosen to remain in northern Cyprus.  On that ground alone, your age is a factor which counts to some extent in your favour.  I make it plain however that in my judgment  your  age  does  not  assist  you  in  any  other  way,  for  the  simple  reason  that you chose to flee the jurisdiction and remain absent from this country for 17 years.  If you had stood trial in 1993, as you should have done, you would have been 52 years old.   I have considered but rejected other possible mitigating features. You are not assisted by the fact that you yourself lost a lot of money when PPI’s share price collapsed: that was another self-inflicted wound. Finally I should mention that there is here no mitigation in the nature of remorse for your past offending. You were entitled to have your trial, and you were entitled before that trial to make the several applications you did seeking on legal grounds to prevent the trial ever going ahead. The fact that you exercised those rights does not make your crimes  more  serious  than  they  already  are,  and  does  not  in  any  way  increase  the sentences  which  would  otherwise  be  appropriate.  But  it  does  mean  that  I  have  had the opportunity to observe you not only throughout the months which this trial has occupied  but  also  at  the  many  pre-trial  hearings  which  I  have  conducted  since  late 2010.  You are a man of considerable charm and unfailing courtesy, and it is sad to see the waste of your undoubted talents.  But I have no hesitation in concluding that you  have  shown  not  the  slightest  remorse  for  your  crime.  Your  sole  concern throughout has been to avoid any acceptance of your own responsibility.      Balancing  those  various  factors,  it  is  in  my  judgment  clear  that  the  aggravating features  substantially  outweigh  the  mitigating  features.    I  am  nonetheless  able  to reflect  such  mitigation  as  there  is  by  reducing  the  total  sentence  which  I  would otherwise  have  passed.    That  total  is  reduced  by  2  years  to  reflect  the  mitigating features which I have identified. Page 7 of 9     I take into account the submissions ably made on your behalf by Mr Hackett.  I take into account also the recent cases which counsel have put before me as indications of the  appropriate  level  of  sentence.    I  agree  with  Mr  Hackett  that  none  of  them  is closely analogous to your case.   I have no doubt that each of your ten offences is so very serious that only a sentence of  imprisonment  is  appropriate,  and  that  the  starting  point  for  each  individual offence  should  be  a  sentence  at  or  near  the  top  of  the  range  indicated  by  the sentencing guidelines.  But of course you are not to be sentenced for only one offence.  Where  offences  are  committed  over  a  significant  period  of  time,  the  court  has  to consider whether concurrent sentences would properly reflect the overall criminality.  In  your  case,  they  would  not.    There  must  be  some  consecutive  sentencing  to  mark your persistence in offending repeatedly over a lengthy period.  In particular, it would in my judgment be wholly wrong not to mark by way of consecutive sentencing your continuing  to  offend  after  the  warning  given  to  you  in  October  1989.    The  fact  that consecutive  sentences  produce  a  total  which  exceeds  the  statutory  maximum  for  a single offence is no bar.  Indeed, there is no bar in principle to the court imposing the maximum  sentence  on  each  of  two  or  more  offences  and  ordering  them  to  run consecutively.   That brings me to the final consideration which the court must have in mind, namely the principle of totality.  If I simply passed the appropriate prison sentence on each count,  and  made  each  of  them  consecutive  to  all  others,  the  total  would  be  far  too high.  I must therefore step back and limit the aggregate sentencing to a total which is proportionate to the overall criminality.  I make it clear that in doing so my primary consideration is the totality of my sentencing, not the precise structure by which that totality is achieved.   My  duty  is  to  determine  the  appropriate  sentence,  not  to  direct  when  you  will  be released.  I must however explain to you the practical effect of my sentence.  Counsel have researched the relevant statutory provisions, and I accept that the effect of them is as follows.  You will serve half of the total sentence which I am about to pronounce.  You  will  then  be  released  on  licence  for  the  remainder  of  the  total  term.  When  so Page 8 of 9 released,  you  will  be  subject  to  the  conditions  of  your  licence,  and  the  Secretary  of State will have the power to withdraw your licence and order your return to prison. On  counts  1,  2,  3,  5,  6,  7  and  8  there  will  be  concurrent  sentences  of  5  years’ imprisonment.    On  counts  10,  12  and  13  there  will  be  sentences  of  5  years’ imprisonment:  those  three  sentences  will  be  concurrent  with  each  other  but consecutive to the other seven sentences.  Your total sentence, accordingly, is one of  10 years’ imprisonment.                            Page 9 of 9 ",

          "context": " Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Kerr   The Queen -v-Edwin Pyott  Birmingham Crown Court  11 December 2015   1.\t  2.\t  3.\t  4.\t  5.\t  6.\t Mr Pyott, please remain seated for the moment.  Last February, you attacked Danny McDermott with a knife and killed him, for no obvious reason. He thought you were his friend, yet you stabbed him to death in the neck. You went up to Mr McDermott’s flat to visit him. He had drunk a lot of alcohol and was probably intoxicated. While you were there, you took a knife and inflicted vicious stab wounds to his neck. He was unable to defend himself.  It was a brutal, senseless act of horrifying violence. You left his sister without her beloved brother and his young daughters forever deprived of their father. You took from his mother the son she misses so much. Their lives are blighted by your cruelty. For this offence of murder, the sentence I am required by law to pass is one of life imprisonment.  I have to determine the minimum term of imprisonment which you must serve before being eligible to apply to the Parole Board to be considered for release. To do so, I have to consider the provisions of Schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 regarding the seriousness of the offence, to determine the minimum term of that life sentence that you must serve as the punishment and deterrent term of the sentence, before consideration can be given to your release.  7.\t A minimum term is not the same as an ordinary sentence of imprisonment where a defendant will normally serve only half of 1           that sentence before being released on licence.  A minimum term is the term that must be served before your case may be referred to the Parole Board for consideration of your release upon licence.  It means the actual length of time that you will spend in prison before that process can take place.  8.\t  Whether or not you will be released after the minimum term has been served will be for the Parole Board to consider at the end of the minimum term.  The Parole Board will not decide that you can be released at that stage, unless it is satisfied that you are not a risk to the public, and are ready for release into society.  9.\t  10.\t If you are released at that time, or any later time, you will be released on licence with specific conditions attached, and may be recalled to continue serving your life sentences if you breach any licence conditions that are imposed upon you. The prosecution have accepted, and I accept, that you did not take the knife to the scene of the murder.  I therefore take the statutory starting point for the minimum term as 15 years.  I reach that starting point without taking account, at this stage, of aggravating and mitigating features in your case which I now consider.  11.\t The period I take as the starting point must be substantially increased because of the following aggravating features:  (1) This was a brutal and ferocious knife attack, involving several stab wounds to the neck. You deliberately took up that fearful weapon and used it to cut his neck.   (2) You are a strong and heavily built man. Mr McDermott was not. He could not match your strength. There were no defensive injuries. He was defenceless against you.  (3) You were on friendly terms with Mr McDermott. He invited you into his flat. You betrayed him and killed him in his own home. (4) After stabbing him fatally, you rifled through his pockets to  find his keys which you stole and used to let yourself out and lock the door of the flat from the outside. (5) You then cleaned the knife and disposed of your bloodstained  clothing, intending to avoid punishment by destroying forensic evidence against you.  (6) You lied afterwards, repeatedly denied the murder and said those to whom you had confessed were lying. This must, though, be balanced against your admissions and expressions of regret. (7) I am sure, also, that you tried to hide your guilt by cutting  2             your arm to simulate the effect a struggle; and by suggesting officers check your flat for forensic evidence you knew was not there.  12.\t  13.\t  These aggravating factors make it necessary to adjust the 15 year starting point substantially upwards, to a minimum term that would be in the region of 23½ years before taking account of mitigating features.  Those mitigating factors are:   (1) You did not, as the Crown accepts and I accept, intend to kill Danny McDermott, although you set out to cause him really serious injury with the knife.   (2) The offence was not premeditated. You formed the intention to harm Mr McDermott very shortly before you stabbed him. You did not arm yourself with the knife beforehand.  (3) You confessed to several friends and to your mother that you had done the killing, and expressed regret and distress. That must be balanced against your lies and attempts to deceive.  (4) You suffer from a severe abnormality of mental functioning. I have taken careful note of the psychiatric evidence for the defence, including a recent addendum from Dr Collins. This reduces your culpability to a limited extent. I have taken account of what the Court of Appeal said in McFly [2013] EWCA Crim 729. In my judgment the effect of those mitigating factors would be to reduce the appropriate minimum term to about 20½ years, before  considering your criminal record and before giving you any credit for your guilty plea.  You have a long history of violent offending, including three robberies committed with the help of a knife used to threaten your victims and, in one case, to injure one of them. 16.\t  Mr Atkins QC, who spoke eloquently on your behalf, reminded me  that those offences were committed quite a long time ago, in late 2004. That is true. You were sentenced to 7½ years in February 2005. You were then in prison or secure hospital until your release on licence in December 2009. You were recalled to prison after only four days because you had threatened a member of staff with violence at the hostel where you had been placed, and remained in  prison until the end of April 2012 (pp.27-30 of Dr Collins’ report).  18.\t You committed this offence just under three years later, on 10 3   14.\t  15.\t  17.\t        February 2015. I do not accept that your previous convictions are irrelevant. You are a man with a long history of inflicting violence on innocent people, fuelled by abuse of Class A drugs and alcohol. In view of your previous violent offending, I would increase the appropriate minimum term for this murder to one of 22 years. However, I must consider the amount by which that period should be reduced to give you appropriate credit for your plea of guilty. I have taken account of the relevant sentencing guideline, and the remarks of the Court of Appeal in Evans (John) [2014] EWCA Crim 1916. You were entitled to explore with your legal and medical advisers the possibility of diminished responsibility. I do not hold that against you. Yet, despite your mental disorder you showed a canny understanding of the legal process including tactical considerations, you mixed truth with lies in the aftermath of the killing and you disposed of evidence to escape punishment.  22.\t  Moreover, after you were found fit to plead by Dr Collins in mid-September 2015, you continued to maintain your innocence and, in the defence statement signed on 9 October 2015, you ran defences of accident and self-defence. Against that background, you pleaded guilty to murder last week, on the first day of your trial, after being examined by Dr Sanikop. Mr Atkins QC submits that you had admitted the killing straight away. But you admitted it only to some people. Those admissions apart, you did all you could to avoid paying for your crime. In all the circumstances, I think 10 per cent credit for your guilty plea is slightly too generous a discount. Stand up please, Mr Pyott. The sentence of the court for the murder of Danny McDermott is life imprisonment, with a minimum term to be served of 20 years, less 298 days spent on remand in custody awaiting trial.   The statutory charges apply.  19.\t  20.\t  21.\t  23.\t  24.\t  25.\t  26.\t 4          ",

          "context": "     R ‐V‐ NATHAN PICK  NOTTINGHAM CROWN COURT   10 MAY 2013     SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE FLAUX                                                1.\t  Nathan Pick on 8 May 2013 you pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of your 7  month old son James Pick who died a year ago on 9 May 2012. At the time    you  lived  with  the  baby’s  mother,  your  then  partner  Hannah  Goldby  in   Chaddesden, Derby.  The background to this tragic death is as follows. James   was born on 5 October 2011 with  a number of medical problems requiring  surgical  treatment,  including  corrective  heart  surgery.  A  little  over  three  months  of  his  early  life  were  spent  in  hospital.  These  medical  difficulties   meant he had to be fed through a naso‐gastric tube. I accept that you helped  with this task. Despite these problems once settled at home he was reported   as growing well and developing normally.                                                                                                  2.\t  Up  until  about  March  last  year  your  relationship  with  your  son  appeared   normal, but around that time it changed for the worse. Whenever you went  near  James he  would  become  distressed and  scream  or  cry. As soon  as his  mother  took  him  he  would  settle  down.  You  clearly  found  this  reaction  of  your son frustrating and upsetting and described it to a cousin of Hannah’s in   April  2012  as  breaking  your  heart.  The  problems  you  had  of  bonding  with  James and  the  demands of  caring  for  him  put a  strain  on your  relationship   with Hannah. You told her you could not cope with the crying and wanted to   give up.                                                                                           3.\t  On  Sunday  6  May  2012  Hannah  left  you  alone  for  the  day  with  James  and   went to her mother’s. You rang up clearly stressed saying James would not   stop screaming and could Hannah come home. She said she would return in  an hour but you asked her to come straight away such was the stress. When  she  walked  into  the  house  he  stopped  crying  and  you  said  “thank  fuck  for    that”.                                                         4.\t  On Tuesday 8 May 2012 in the afternoon the three of you went into Derby  city  centre.  On  arrival  you  went  off  on  your  own  to  chill  out  with  friends   whilst Hannah and James went shopping then went home where she fed him.                                       1                                                                        You  got  home  about  5.30.  Hannah’s  mother  came  round  with  some  medication for the baby shortly before 6.15. You and Hannah decided to have   fish and chips and her mother drove her to the local fish bar to buy the food.  At  the  time  she  left  James  was  asleep  in  his  swing  chair.  Almost  on  arrival   inside the shop at about 6.26 so only some ten minutes after she had left you  alone with the baby, she had a telephone call from you asking her to come  back quickly, saying he’s fitting and I think he’s dead. She came back having     told  you  to  dial  999  which  you  did.  The  ambulance  came  and  James  was   taken initially to Royal Derby Hospital then to the QMC here in Nottingham. A   CT  scan  and  subsequent  MRI  scan  revealed  extensive  brain  injury  with   haemorrhaging,  brain  swelling  and  bleeding  into  the  spinal  cord  and   examination by an eye specialist revealed extensive injuries to the backs of  the eyes including haemorrhages and retinal detachment. It became clear to   all the treating doctors that further intensive care was futile and James was   taken off life support and died at 10.26pm on 9 May 2012.                                                                                                                         5.\t  The  post  mortem  examinations  by  Dr  Stuart  Hamilton  and  other  specialist    pathologists  found  numerous  head  injuries  and  extensive  brain  injury  and   catastrophic  bleeding  to  the  eyes  and  retina  all  indicative  of  severe  blunt   trauma and inconsistent with an accident or with accidental impact with the  baby’s swing chair which is what you were suggesting had happened. Despite  the weight of that medical evidence pointing to deliberate infliction of these  injuries  upon  the  baby,  until  your  plea  of  guilty  two  days  ago  you  were    maintaining  you  were  not  responsible,  that  the injuries  had  arisen   accidentally or that James’ mother was in some way to blame.                                                                                                                 6.\t  As you now accept by your plea of guilty to manslaughter, you had caused   those injuries which led to James’ death. When Hannah went out to fetch fish  and  chips,  as  always  happened  when  the  baby  was  left  alone  with  you,  he   started  screaming.  The  stress  and  frustration  that  generated  in  you  caused  you  to  snap  and  in  momentary  anger  you  hit  James  with  the  back  of  your   hand so that he hit his head on the chair. You did not intend to kill him or  cause him serious physical injury, but again, as your guilty plea demonstrates,  you  now  accept  that  this  blow  was  an  unlawful  act  which  any  reasonable  person  would  have  realised  would  cause  James  some  physical  harm.  How  could it be otherwise with a small vulnerable baby?                                                                                                                         7.\t  This is a tragic case in which a moment of anger and frustration caused the  death of your baby son, a senseless act of violence with the consequences of    which you will have to live for the rest of your life. It has ruined the life of    your ex‐partner Hannah who had already previously lost another baby Zoe in  a cot death and it has devastated her family. I have considered the moving    impact statement from Hannah. Inevitably as people do in such situations she  asks herself over and over what she could have done to stop you and blames  herself, when the stark reality is that only you are to blame for the death of  your son. I have also borne in mind in sentencing you the effect on your other   child, your 12 year old son.                                                                                             2                 8.\t  Manslaughter  is  a  serious  offence  for  the  purposes  of  the  dangerousness   provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 but I am satisfied that you are not   dangerous within the meaning of those provisions. Nonetheless the case is of   such  seriousness  that  it  passes  the  custody  threshold  and  clearly  only  a  substantial custodial sentence would be appropriate to meet the seriousness  of the offence you have admitted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                9.\t  The authorities on sentencing for manslaughter since the enactment of the  Criminal Justice Act 2003 have emphasised that whilst there is no express link  between the guidance in Schedule 21 to that Act as it applies to murder and   sentencing for manslaughter, the Act has increased the punitive element in   the sentence for murder and the intention of Parliament is clear that other  crimes which result in death such as manslaughter should be treated more   seriously  and  dealt  with  more  severely  than  before.  That  point  was  made  expressly  in  the  context  of  diminished  responsibility  manslaughter  by  Lord   Judge CJ in R v Wood [2010] 1 Cr App R(S) 2 at [23]. Precisely the same point   was  made  by  the  Lord  Chief  Justice  in  the  context  of  unlawful  act  manslaughter arising out of street disorder in  Appleby [2010] 2 Cr App R(S)  46 at [22].      10. In\t  R  v  Burridge  [2010]  EWCA  Crim  2847  at  [137]  to  [139]  Leveson  LJ   considered  those  authorities  and  concluded  the  principles  set  out  in  those  authorities  applied  equally  to  unlawful  act  manslaughter  of  babies  and  children.  In that case the defendant was convicted of the murder of his baby  son, but on appeal the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on the grounds of   fresh  evidence  and  substituted  a  verdict  of  manslaughter.  In  those   circumstances the defendant fell to be sentenced by the Court of Appeal for    manslaughter.  The  Court  of  Appeal  substituted  a  sentence  of  10  years    imprisonment for the original sentence for murder of life imprisonment with    a minimum term of 13 years.     11. Your counsel Mr Smith QC relies upon the subsequent decision of the Court   of  Appeal  in  Draper  [2011]  EWCA  Crim  640  as  setting  Burridge  in  context.  That was an Attorney General’s Reference in respect of a sentence of three  and  a  half  years  imprisonment  in  fact  by  the  same  trial  judge  as  Burridge   where, as in this case, the defendant had killed his baby son and had been   originally  charged  with  murder  but  a  plea  of  manslaughter  was  eventually   accepted  by  the  prosecution.  The  Court  of  Appeal  found  the  sentence  was  too  lenient  and  substituted  one  of  5  years  imprisonment.  It  is  to  be  noted   that  in  his  judgment  the  Lord  Chief  Justice  endorsed  the  conclusion  by  the   Court in Burridge that the principles in Wood and Appleby applied equally to    cases of unlawful act manslaughter of babies and children.     12. In Draper the Court of Appeal imposed a lesser sentence than in Burridge in   part  because  as  Mr  Smith  emphasised  some  of  the  aggravating  features  in   Burridge  were  absent  in  that  case,  specifically  that,  in  Burridge,  the                                                                                                                                                                                                             3                                                                                                                                                                                                             defendant’s intention fell just short of what would be the requisite intent for   murder,  that  in  that  case  the  defendant  had  committed  previous  proven  violent  acts  against  the  child,  that  he  had  been  warned  previously  to  seek   help about his bad temper and that he lied to the authorities about his care   of the child. With the possible exception that in this case you have lied about  your  responsibility  until  this  week  I  agree  with  Mr  Smith  that  those     aggravating features in Burridge are equally absent in your case.      13. However,  as  the  Court  of  Appeal  made  clear  in  Draper  the  sentence  of  5  years  imprisonment  was  substituted  on  the  basis  that  the  defendant  was   entitled  to  a  full  one  third  credit  for  his  plea  of  guilty  so  that  sentence   equated to one of 7 and a half years after a full trial. Furthermore, as with all  Attorney General’s references one has to recognise that where the Court of   Appeal increases the sentence it has in mind the principle of double jeopardy   and  imposes  a  lower  sentence  than  would  have  been  imposed  at  trial.   Applying that principle it seems to me Draper should be approached on the   basis that the appropriate sentence by the sentencing judge would have been   8 and a half years following a trial.      14. Whilst I agree with Mr Smith that the aggravating features identified by the   Court  of  Appeal  in  Burridge  are  absent  here  as  they  were  in  Draper,  nonetheless there are aggravating features. As in Draper this is not a case of  a  parent  driven  to  the  end  of  his  tether  by  the  child.  You  were  alone  with   James for no more than ten minutes and so it is difficult to see how that kind  of  end  of  your  tether  situation  could  have  developed  in  that  short  a  time   frame. The reality is that for whatever reason your baby son would not bond   with you and cried whenever he came near you. No doubt that was upsetting   and frustrating but it could hardly be said to be something for which a seven  month old baby could be to blame and Hannah had urged you to be patient    and to persevere, which clearly you did not do.      15. Equally, as in Draper, until the moment earlier this week when you pleaded   guilty  to  manslaughter,  you  have  lied  about  your  responsibility  for  what   happened to your baby son, even to the extent of seeking to attribute to his  mother  the  violence  you  inflicted  on  the  child.  On  any  view  that  is  an   aggravating feature justifying a greater sentence than you would otherwise   receive. Furthermore, although in Draper the defendant sought to explain the  baby’s injuries as attributable to some accident in the baby bouncer as you   have done here, he did not seek to blame the baby’s mother as you did, with  all the agonising consequences for Hannah in this case. That accusation albeit  no  longer  pursued  is  an  additional  aggravating  feature  absent  in  Draper.   Having said that, I accept that this is not a case in which, as in Draper, there  was  some  prior  warning  of  what  might  happen  if  the  child’s  head  hit  the   chair.   16. In sentencing you I take into account everything Mr Smith has said on your   behalf in mitigation, including the genuine remorse you have shown together                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            4      with  your  previous  good  character,  from  which  I  conclude  that  as  the   prosecution fairly accepts, you are not a bad or violent man. I accept also that    this is not a case of an unwanted child but of a child you wanted and loved   and that you had never previously shown violence towards James or towards   your other son.                                                                                                                                                  17. Nonetheless\t  as  the  Court  of  Appeal  decisions  to  which  I  have  referred   emphasise the court has to focus on the fact that a victim, here a defenceless   and vulnerable baby who was your own child, has died as a consequence of  your unlawful act. In my judgment if this matter had gone to a trial and the  jury had convicted you of manslaughter the appropriate sentence would have    been one of 8 and a half years imprisonment.     18. Unlike in Draper there is no question of your being entitled to a full credit for    your  plea  of  guilty.  In  the  light  of  the  overwhelming  medical  evidence  that   the injuries suffered by baby James were deliberate and not accidental you  could and should have pleaded guilty at a much earlier stage. You did not in   fact do so until 8 May 2013 the day when the trial was due to start although  ultimately  some  week  and  a  bit  before  the  actual  trial  date.  However,     exceptionally  I  take  into  account  that  the  plea  you  have  entered  has  been      In  the under  consideration  with  Mr  Smith  QC  for  about  a  month.      circumstances you are entitled to more credit than the one tenth you would      normally get for a guilty plea just before the trial. The sentence is one of 7     years imprisonment, so a credit of just under 20 per cent.       19. Of that sentence, you will spend one half in custody, after which you will be   released on licence for the remainder of the sentence. If, during your licence   period  you  commit  any  other  offence  you  are  likely  to  be  returned  to  custody.  The  days  spent  on  remand  will  count  towards  the  sentence.  The   statutory surcharge provisions will apply.                                                                                                                                              5      ",

          "context": "       1.  2.  3. 4. 5.   Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Popplewell  R v Justin Robertson & Ben Carr  Winchester Crown Court  21st April 2015 Pennie Davis was newly married for only three months when she was stabbed to death as she tended her horses in a field in the New Forest last September.  It was a brutal attack in which at least 10 blows were struck. It was a contract killing.  Justin Robertson, aged 36, was the killer.  Ben Carr, aged 22, recruited him to carry out the murder.   Ben Carr was incensed at facebook messages which she had posted two weeks before the killing, in which she threatened to revive allegations first made when she was the partner of Ben Carr’s father in 2006.  Ben Carr was then aged 14 and living in the family unit with his father and Pennie and her five younger daughters.  At that time Pennie Davis accused Ben Carr sexually assaulting two of her daughters, then aged 10 and 12.   Those allegations were never investigated.  For the purposes of sentencing I proceed on the assumption that they were unfounded.  They had made Ben Carr bitter for many years and their revival last summer determined him to silence Pennie Davis for ever.   The very same day that the facebook messages were sent, Ben Carr approached Justin Robertson, whom he knew because they were both Class A drug dealers.  Justin Robertson is a career criminal with a string of convictions for theft and burglaries.  Ben Carr was to pay him £1,500.  He persuaded Justin Robertson to kill her not just by paying him money, but by a perversion of the allegations Pennie Davis had made.  Ben Carr told Justin Robertson that she was a paedophile, a nonce in Justin Robertson’s vocabulary, which Ben Carr knew would push a button with Justin Robertson because he hated nonces with a passion.  In their twisted minds this was a justification for killing. Over the next two weeks Ben Carr and Justin Robertson carefully planned the killing.  In the week before hand there were several meetings a day, some in the early hours of the morning, and many communications by phone.  Reconnaissance was carried out on her, which included Justin Robertson following her on at least two occasions to the field where she died.  They chose it as the location for the murder because of its remoteness and her vulnerability.   Justin Robertson   The sentence which I am required by law to impose upon you for the murder of Pennie Davis is one of life imprisonment.  I have to determine the minimum term of imprisonment which you will serve before being eligible to apply to the Parole Board to be considered for release. This case falls under paragraph 5(1) of Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 because the seriousness of the offence is particularly high.  It was a murder for gain.  The starting point is 30 years. 9. In your case there are the following aggravating features: i.  This was a carefully prepared, planned and premeditated ii.  You targeted a helpless woman alone in a field in a murder. remote location. iii.  The stabbing was brutal and ferocious, causing no doubt terror and physical suffering before she died. iv.  You have shown no remorse. v.  Your conduct in the witness box was deplorable.  You were arrogant and offensive.  You addressed your victim’s family in the public gallery in a way bound to increase their distress.  You openly made threats to kill Ben Carr.  It was a disgusting and misguided attempt at bravado.   There are no mitigating features.  You also fall to be sentenced for another offence for which you were on bail when you carried out this murder.  You pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods which were the product of a night time burglary of a florists shop in Gloucestershire in August 2013.  The goods in question were greetings cards, picture frames and bunches of roses.  Giving full credit for your guilty plea and taking into account your record, I will impose a custodial term for that offence which will run concurrently with the sentence for the murder.    6. 7.  8.    10.  11.    Ben Carr           12.  13. 14. 15. 16. 17.  Taking all these matters into account:  The sentence of the Court for the murder is Life Imprisonment, with a minimum term to be served of 32 years, less 217 days to reflect the period you have spent on remand awaiting trial.    On the handling charge I impose a concurrent sentence of 4 months imprisonment   The statutory charges apply. You have been convicted of conspiracy to murder.  I am satisfied from the circumstances of this offence that you are dangerous: you pose a significant risk of causing serious harm by committing further specified offences.   Your part in this murder was no less culpable than that of JR although you did not deliver the fatal blows yourself.  It was your plan, for your ends, and I am satisfied that you were an equal partner in planning its execution. In accordance with s. 225 Criminal Justice Act 2003, the seriousness of the offence justifies the imposition of a life sentence.   I am required by law to determine the minimum term of imprisonment which you will serve before being eligible to apply to the Parole Board to be considered for release.  In doing so I have regard to terms of Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, although they do not directly apply.  In this case it is appropriate that the same considerations should apply to you as would apply if you had carried out the killing yourself.  Your share of the blame is no less than that of Justin Robertson.   In your case there are the same aggravating features I have already identified for Justin Robertson, save for that relating to his conduct in the witness box. There is one mitigating factor in your case which is your youth.  Its force is tempered by the fact that although you are only 22, you are already a hardened criminal dealing high purity cocaine.     Taking all these matters into account: The sentence of the Court is Life Imprisonment, with a minimum term to be served of 30 years less 178 days to reflect the period you have spent on remand awaiting trial.    The statutory charge applies.       -ENDS- ",

          "context": "    Guildford Crown Court R ‐v‐ Benjamin Curtis Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Nicol 17th June 2013  You may stay seated for the time being.  Benjamin Curtis you have pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Ocean Elliott.  Ocean was 3 ½ months old in April 2007. She was your child and in your sole care. Like most babies, she cried. You picked her up and shook her 4 or 5 times. You may have been tired. You may have been uncertain as to how to placate Ocean. You may have been cross with your partner. But none of that is any excuse whatsoever for your loss of temper and mistreatment of that baby.  The results were catastrophic.  A baby that young has undeveloped neck muscles. If  shaken violently, her head will have swung back and forth and her brain will have knocked against the inside of her skull. The brain injury which resulted had devastating effects. She was severely disabled. She could not sit on her own, let alone walk. She was functionally blind. She could not clear her lungs properly in the way that everybody else takes for granted. She had to be fed through a tube inserted into her body. In the course of 2009 she contracted pneumonia and then later swine flu. She suffered from seizures.  As time progressed these occurred every day and were difficult for even doctors to control. Her distress was clear to those who were caring for her.  You have already been prosecuted once for inflicting really serious harm on Ocean. You were acquitted of intentionally causing her really serious harm. I acknowledge that what you did not with intentional malice to that baby. The conviction for assault  was in February 2008. But at that time, Ocean was still alive. The present case started after her death. Consequences matter and when the consequences become the more serious, they can lead, as in your case, to more serious charges.  You are now 30 years old. I have seen and taken into account the pre‐sentence report which was prepared for the previous case. That notes you have a learning disability and a limited ability to understand verbal information. Your previous convictions and police record are not material to the task I have to perform with two qualifications. One is the assault on Ocean which I have already mentioned and to which I will return. The other is that you were cautioned in 2006 for hitting Ocean’s step‐brother on  his bare bottom. That, too, was, it seems, in a fit of temper.  The pre‐sentence report also recognised that you had taken full responsibility for your actions. You pleaded guilty to the assault on Ocean, although only on the day of your previous trial.        In these proceedings you have not resiled from your admission of responsibility for shaking Ocean. You did originally plead not guilty to the present charge, but, I accept that this was because of two matters which turned on expert evidence: whether your conduct was a significant contributory cause to Ocean’s death 2 ½ years later; and whether Ocean’s brain injury could possibly have been due to some other non‐accidental injury. These were not matters within your own knowledge. It was only last week that your legal team obtained clear evidence from the experts they had commissioned to say that it was plain your shaking had been a contributory cause of death and it was not possible that the injury to Ocean’s brain could have been the result of any earlier incident. This is therefore an unusual case where the lateness of  your plea of guilty should not be held against you. I will give you full credit for it.  I also recognise that you have been previously prosecuted for the same wrongful act. I will, of course, make a reduction for the sentence which was then imposed. But over and above that, I should mark that this is the second time you have been through criminal proceedings and, as your counsel submitted, you did have to wait over 3 years after Ocean’s death before you were charged with manslaughter and learned that you were indeed to face a second prosecution. In that interval, you were convicted of another offence, but it was of a quite different kind and the magistrates thought it could be dealt with adequately by a conditional discharge and a restraining order. It is therefore of little importance in my decision in the present matter.  Your counsel recognises that this offence is so serious that only a sentence of immediate imprisonment will be sufficient.   Taking all of this into account (including the sentence which was passed on you for the assault on Ocean) but assuming you had contested the present charge, my sentence would have been 3 years imprisonment. Because of your plea of guilty, the sentence will be one of 2 years imprisonment.   Stand up.  Benjamin Curtis for the manslaughter of Ocean Elliott you are sentenced to 2 years imprisonment.

          "context": " Regina v. Indre BARYSAITE Dimitrius JAKIMOVAS Sentencing Remarks   1 Indre Barysaite and Dimitrius Jakimovas, the jury have found you guilty of the murder of Zygimantas Kromelys on Sunday 10 November 2019.     You, Indre Barysaite, were engaged to be married to Mr Kromelys.  You,  Dimitrius Jakimovas, were his friend.  Nevertheless, one of you stabbed Mr Kromelys through the heart when the three of you were alone together in  the  home  which  you  shared  in  Rotherham.  The  other  deliberately  assisted or encouraged the stabbing.  Neither of you have explained why you did this.  It remains a mystery.        There does not appear to have been a struggle.  Mr Kromelys was stabbed  only once.  The blade passed between his ribs, through his heart and into  his  lung, which  collapsed.  There was  massive  internal  bleeding,  with  3 litres of blood being found in his chest cavity.  Mercifully for him, death  came quickly.     For his family, however, there is a lifetime of grief.  I have read the moving statement by his sister, Diana Vitkute, in which she has set out in powerful  terms the devastating effect of your actions on every member of his family.      1.\t 2.\t 3.\t 4.\t I have to impose a sentence of life imprisonment.  However, I also have to decide the minimum term which you will serve before you are eligible to be considered for release by the Parole Board.      It  is  important  that  you,  and  everyone  concerned  with  this  case,  should understand what a minimum term means.  A minimum term is not a fixed  term after  which you will  automatically  be released.  It is the  minimum   time which you will spend in custody before your case can be considered  by the Parole Board.  It will then be for the Parole Board to say whether or not you will be released.  If they do not, you will remain in custody.          If and when you are released, you will still be subject to licence.  This will remain the case for the rest of your life.  If for any reason your licence were to be revoked, you would be recalled to prison to continue to serve your life sentence in custody.    The law says that the starting point is a minimum term of 15 years.  I have to consider whether I should adjust that figure up or down, so I have to consider all of the aggravating and mitigating factors.    The principal aggravating factor is the use of a knife.  Although I do not know which of you used the knife, the jury have found by their verdicts that you each intended that Mr Kromelys should be stabbed.     There are three aggravating factors which are particular to you, Dimitrius Jakimovas.  First, you were by your own admission heavily intoxicated.  By contrast, while you, Indre Barysaite, had also had something to drink, there has been no suggestion that you were intoxicated.     Secondly, you, Dimitrius Jakimovas, have accepted that you picked up the  knife and placed it in water in a bowl in the sink.  I am sure that this was an attempt to conceal evidence.  The police did not find it there, so I am sure  that  you  moved  it  again,  rinsing  or  washing  it  and  putting  it  in  the cutlery drawer.  The expert evidence was that three of the knives found in  that drawer could have been the murder weapon and that it was possible that the murder weapon had little or no blood or tissue on it.         Thirdly, you were convicted in 2017 by a court in Lithuania of the infliction in  2016  of  physical  pain  or  minor  bodily  harm,  for  which  you  were  sentenced  to 15  months’ imprisonment, suspended for 18 months.  That was an offence of violence, although it was nothing like as serious as the present offence.  Moreover, you are 33 and it is your only conviction for a violent offence.  2  5.\t 6.\t 7.\t 8.\t 9.\t 10.\t 11.\t 12.\t  The mitigating factors are as follows.  First, I cannot be sure that either of you intended to kill Mr Kromelys.  That is because I cannot be sure which of you stabbed Mr Kromelys.  There was only a single blow of moderate force.    14.\tSecondly, there is no evidence that the murder was premeditated.   Thirdly, you, Indre Barysaite,  are 30 and you have no relevant previous convictions. Fourthly,  I  bear  in  mind  the  additional  burdens  involved  in  a  prison  sentence  served  at  the  present  time  and  served  by  someone  who  speaks little English.      \t Although you, Indre Barysaite, had harmed yourself in the past, between 8 17.\t and 10 years ago, following the death of your daughter, I do not accept that your degree of culpability was lowered by any mental disorder or mental disability.  There has been no medical or other evidence to that effect.    13.\t 15.\t 16.\t 18.\t    Similarly,  I  do  not  accept  that  you  were  provoked.  You  did  not  give  evidence to that effect.  You were angry that Mr Kromelys had stopped for a drink on his way back from the shop at about 9 pm and you questioned him  repeatedly  about  it.  Mr  Jakimovas’  evidence  was  that,  on  that occasion,  Mr  Kromelys  had  one  swig  from  a  200  ml  bottle  of  vodka, equivalent to about a double measure of vodka.            \t His drinking was a regular source of arguments between you, but you had 19.\tbeen with him all evening when he had been drinking.  The three of you went  to  a  shop  and  alcohol  was  purchased.  You  were  aware  that  Mr Jakimovas twice went with him to another shop, where more alcohol was purchased each time.  Moreover, after the event, in a conversation recorded on a police officer’s body worn video camera, Mr Jakimovas said that it was you who had been provoking.        20.\t I have to make an order that you each pay a victim surcharge.  The order will be drawn up in the appropriate amount.     21.\tIndre Barysaite, I impose on you a sentence of life imprisonment.    22.\t   I fix the minimum term which you will serve in custody at 14 years, less the time which you have spent in custody on remand.  I am told that you have spent 416 days in custody on remand, so the minimum term will be If  that  figure  is  wrong,  it  can  be  corrected 12  years  and  315  days. administratively, without the need for you to come back to court.          3  \t Dimitrius Jakimovas, I impose on you a sentence of life imprisonment.   23.\t 24.\t  I fix the minimum term which you will serve in custody at 14 years and 8  months, less the time which you have spent in custody on remand.  I am  told that you have spent 416 days in custody on remand, so the minimum  term  will  be  13  years  and  132  days.  If  that  figure  is  wrong,  it  can  be     corrected administratively, without the need for you to come back to court.                    Mr Justice Lavender 31  December 2020   4 ",

          "context": "      20th July 2012   In the Southwark Crown Court  Mr Justice Fulford  Between:      Background and submissions  Regina ‐v‐ Simon Harwood  Judgment 1.  This decision concerns two reports on the Mail’s Online website concerning inadmissible material relating to alleged earlier incidents of violence on the part of the defendant.  2.  On 22 May 2012 I decided in a Ruling (handed down in writing) that the prosecution was not entitled to introduce evidence of two alleged previous incidents of bad character, namely:  FIRST:  Material  relating  to  an  event  on  25th  May  2005  when  the defendant was allegedly involved with a number of other officers in the arrest  of  Mr.  Owusu‐Afriye.  It  is  alleged  he  used  unnecessary  force  by delivering a knee strike to the left side of Mr. Owusu‐Afriye’s torso, in the area of his kidneys.  SECOND: Evidence relating to an incident on 24th November 2008 when the  defendant  was  involved  with  5  other  officers  in  stopping  and searching the vehicle of Mr. Junior Samms, an AA patrolman. The conduct of  the  defendant  is  said  to  have  been  the  worst  of  the  policemen  who had dealings with Mr. Samms in that it is alleged he twisted Mr. Samms’ arm when he was handcuffed and repeatedly told him to “shut up”.  3.  I noted that:  “[…] in support of the two incidents the prosecution have limited their application to calling two witnesses only: Mr Ward (a passing member of the public) as regards the incident on 25th May 2005 and Mr. Samms for the events on 24th November 2008. The Prosecution does not propose to call Mr. Owusu‐Afriye, Police Constables Calver, Jury, Leung and Wilson, Police Sergeant Paul and a doctor for the incident concerning Mr Owusu‐Afriye and Police Constables Walker, Mitchell and Jackaman and Police Sergeant Bowman and a further officer for the incident concerning Mr Samms. The various police constables were present at both events (Police Sergeant Paul was also present when Mr Owusu‐Afriye was detained) and their statements in varying degrees significantly contradict the accounts of the two complainants. 4.  Against that background, I concluded:     “[…] I have no doubt that pursuant to section 101 (3) this material would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court  ought  not  to  admit  it.  The  jury  would  in  effect  have  to  conduct three  trials,  the  first  relating  to  the  index  offence  and  the  other  two concerning the accused’s alleged propensity to act in the manner alleged against  him  on  1st  April  2009.  The  mixed  factual  and  legal  issues  would become excessively complex, in that the jury would need to ensure that their  approach  to  the  legal  elements  of  the  index  offence  was  only properly  influenced  by  their  factual  findings  reached  to  the  criminal standard in relation to all three incidents. Given the facts on the central incident  are  not  necessarily  at  all  straightforward,  to  add  two  strongly disputed  additional  allegations  for  the  purposes  advanced  by  the prosecution would undoubtedly put the fairness of these proceedings in jeopardy.”   5.  Notwithstanding that Ruling, prior to the commencement of this trial it was brought to my attention by the parties that a number of websites run by various newspapers and at least one broadcaster contained articles that were readily available and dated back to 2010, in which unproven allegations made against PC Harwood were rehearsed (these included the Mail, the Telegraph, the Mirror and Channel 4 News). By way of example, there continued to be readily available on the Mail’s Online website (certainly until late in the trial)                                                                         the following extract that is taken from a longer article entitled “’Cover‐up’ storm over G20 death: Fury as DPP rules policeman who hit news vendor won’t be charged” (dated 23 July 2010):  The PC who left under a cloud PC Simon Harwood, the officer who was accused of killing Ian Tomlinson, left the Met in controversial circumstances several years ago while facing misconduct proceedings over an alleged off‐duty road rage incident.  The 43‐year‐old was allowed to retire on ill health grounds because of a leg or shoulder injury before the disciplinary case, which is said to have involved allegations of violence, it is said.   But after surgery on his injury, he rejoined the force as a civilian operator, dispatching officers to calls, and then after being declared medically fit, was accepted to join Surrey Police as a PC.   Later, despite the outstanding disciplinary proceedings, he transferred back to the Met and was deployed in the riot squad.   Last night Scotland Yard refused to comment on the apparent vetting bungle. It said: “It is not appropriate to comment on the officer’s employment history‐until the completion of any criminal or misconduct proceedings.”  But a source told a Sunday newspaper last year: ‘No former officer with an outstanding disciplinary matter should ever be given his job back.”  6.  In addition, other websites such as “Facebook”, ”You Tube” and “38 degree” published ‘posts’ which shortly before the commencement of the trial contained details of, or referred to, various disciplinary allegations. There were also websites or blogs run by particular individuals in which a variety of contributors expressed their personal opinions on these issues.   7.  In order to address these concerns, a letter I sent to the parties on 31 May 2012 was forwarded by the Crown Prosecution Service to those responsible for the main websites that contain this material, in the following terms:  I am the trial judge in this case. The defendant, a metropolitan police officer, is charged with the manslaughter of Ian Tomlinson during an event on 1 April 2009, namely the violent protest in the City of London that coincided with the meeting of the G20 group of finance ministers and central bank governors from 19 countries and the European Union.  A ruling under the Contempt of Court Act 1981 is in force, and I have attached the terms of the order to this letter.  I am concerned about press reports and other material that remain available on the internet relating to accusations of bad behaviour that have been levelled against the accused that are separate from the incident on 1 April 2009 for which he will stand trial, and which are inadmissible. The relevant publications include (but this list is not exhaustive) i) press reports which were originally published in 2010 and which are accessible via various websites; ii) items on “Facebook”, “You Tube” and “38 degree” that include “posts” concerning disciplinary (and possibly other) allegations; and iii) material on websites (such as Wikipedia) or “blogs” on which individuals express their opinion (including the Ian Bone blog site, “Raewald” and “Unforgiven”). The websites run by newspapers and broadcasters include those hosted by The Telegraph, The Mirror, The Mail, The Guardian and Channel 4 News, although it is highly likely that this extends to other sources.   Internet service providers, Bulletin Board Operators, Web Hosting Services and search engines (such as Google) will need to consider whether they are enabling the publication of this material.   None of these separate allegations of bad behaviour will feature in the evidence in this case, in part because of a ruling that I handed down on 22 May 2012 at Southwark Crown Court.  The continued publication of this material on the internet, or elsewhere, prima facie constitutes a contempt of court within section 1 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 and it is critical – particularly given the impending trial – the Order of the Court is complied with and the publication of this information ceases immediately.  Although this material should be removed from the internet forthwith, I will hear submissions from any individual or body affected by the Contempt of Court Order who wishes to raise any relevant issues during the morning of the first day of the trial on 18 June 2012.     8.  The order referred to in the letter was made on 17 October 2011 by Mr Justice Cooke, in the following terms: 1.  The order made, under section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981, by the Coroner on 26 April 2011, in the inquest proceedings, is to be continued until further order of this Court. The order of 26 April is as follows: Further to the order made orally by the Coroner on 21 March 2011, and for the avoidance of doubt, it is ordered that by virtue of Section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 the publication of the Coroner’s ruling of 31 March 2011 and any legal argument in the absence of the jury on the topic with which the ruling is concerned and this order itself be postponed until further order within the proceedings of the inquest, on the ground that it is necessary for avoiding substantial risk of prejudice to the administration of justice in  these proceedings.   2.  Additional to that order, and for the avoidance of doubt, it is ordered that publication of any information about PC Harwood’s personnel record is postponed until further order of this Court. This order is made on the ground that is necessary to do so to avoid a substantial risk of prejudice to the administration of justice in these proceedings pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981.     9.  At a hearing I convened on 15 June 2012 to hear submissions from the parties and the media as to any further steps that should be taken by the court to address the continued availability of the inadmissible evidence on the internet, one of the issues that arose was whether articles and comments in this category constituted the material publication of information that had been lawfully prohibited by Cooke J’s order. Mr Millar Q.C., who represented a number of media organisations, submitted the order was unlawful and needed to be revised because it related to past reporting rather than relating to the proceedings themselves. I acceded to that submission, given that previous reports of earlier alleged misbehaviour cannot properly fall within the ambit of a power to postpone reports of the proceedings (namely, the trial), and in consequence, I revoked paragraph 2 of Cooke J’s Order.   10. Thereafter, I set out in open court a short rehearsal of my views on this issue. I had concluded that two principal questions had arisen. The first was whether these publications came within the strict liability rule of section 1 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 – namely, the “rule of law whereby conduct may be treated as a contempt of court as tending to interfere with the course of justice in particular legal proceedings regardless of intent to do so” – because they are publications addressed to the public at large or to a section of the public, and because they will “create a substantial risk that the course of justice in the proceedings in question will be seriously […] prejudiced” (see section 1 and section 2 Contempt of Court Act 1981). And, second, whether these publications constituted a contempt in the face of the court. 11. As to the first of those questions, without attempting finally to determine the issue for the purposes of these proceedings, I expressed the view that the internet articles are “publications” for the reasons set out by Lord Osborne in Her Majesty’s Advocate against William Frederick Ian Beggs (No2) 2001 Scot (D) 30/10; 2002 S.L.T. 139. At paragraph 22, the judge in that case observed: It appears to me unrealistic to make a distinction between the moment when the material is first published on the web site and the succeeding period of time when it is available for access on demand by members of the public. It appears to me that the better view is that the situation affecting the web site may be compared with a situation in which a book or other printed material is continuously on sale and available to the public. During that whole period, I consider that it would be proper to conclude that the material was being published.  12. Addressing whether these publications created a substantial risk that the proceedings would be seriously prejudiced, I indicated my view that although judicial directions to the jury are usually effective in ensuring the fair trial of the accused – in this instance by way of an absolute prohibition on any researches into the case or the accused, particularly on the internet – the court should nonetheless take all sensible steps to diminish the risk that jurors may read inadmissible and prejudicial material. In this context, I noted that it is undisputed that the details of the previous allegations levelled at PC Harwood were markedly prejudicial. I intended to give (and I gave) the jury a strong warning not to use the internet in this regard – a warning that the court is entitled to expect will be followed – but applying the approach of Moses LJ in Her Majesty’s Attorney General and Associated Newspapers Ltd and News Group Newspapers Ltd [2011] EWHC 418 (Admin), I concluded that if this material remained on the web and it reached the attention of one or more jurors, it would create a seriously arguable ground of appeal. Although the law assumes that a judge, by making effective orders, thereby secures a safe verdict (in the circumstances of a conviction) that does not negate the contempt caused by the (continued) publication of material that created a substantial risk of seriously prejudicing the proceedings.   13. I highlighted on 15 June 2012 that it was clear, therefore, that this was not a case in which the court was postponing publication of a report of proceedings under section 4 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981. Instead, as I viewed the matter at that stage on the basis of the submissions of the parties and Mr Millar, the court was confronting the kind of rare situation contemplated by Lawton LJ in Balogh v St.Albans Crown Court 1975 QB 73, at page 93 when he observed that a trial judge should only resort to the summary and – as he described it – draconian jurisdiction of summary contempt proceedings “for the purpose of ensuring that a trial in progress or about to start can be brought to a proper and dignified end without disturbance and with a fair chance of a just verdict or judgment” (page 93 letter A). Lawton LJ gave a series of examples, as follows:    The exercise of judicial discretion in this way can be illustrated by reference to the kinds of contempt which are most frequently witnessed by or reported to judges: witnesses and jurors duly summoned who refuse to attend court; witnesses duly sworn who refuse to answer proper questions; persons in court who interrupt the proceedings by insulting the judge, shouting or otherwise making a disturbance; persons in court who assault or attempt to assault or threaten the judge or any officers of the court whose presence is necessary; persons in or out of court who threaten those about to give evidence or who have given evidence; persons in or out of court who threaten or bribe or attempt to bribe jurors or interfere with their coming to court; persons out of court who publish comments about a trial going on by revealing a defendant's criminal record when the rules of evidence exclude it.  14. I indicated that the last example – revealing a defendant’s criminal record – closely matched the situation in the present trial, even allowing for the obvious difference as to whether there had been a concluded criminal trial. In the context of the violence alleged against Mr Harwood in this trial, these previous allegations of violent behaviour leading to misconduct proceedings in the late 1990s and in 2004 would have had a like effect as the jury reading about previous criminal convictions for violence. At that stage, by way of example, material on the Telegraph’s website referred to these as two previous inquiries into allegations of aggression, and one of them is widely reported to have concerned an incident of “road rage” on the part of the defendant. Although the second allegation was in some instances reported as not having been substantiated by the investigating body, the cumulative reporting of the allegations of previous violence on his part created an impression that, in my judgment, was not dissimilar to the situation that arises when an accused’s previous convictions are improperly revealed.   15. Mr Millar submitted that numerous issues of principle may arise if I were to seek to use the Court’s summary powers in this context, but I nonetheless expressed the view on 15 June 2012 that as regards publishers within the jurisdiction (such as domestic newspapers, broadcasters, bloggers etc.) the position is clear, for the reasons just rehearsed. As a result, I stated that if this material was not removed by 8.00 am on Monday 18 June 2012 when the jurors who may serve on this trial were expected to begin arriving at Southwark Crown Court, those responsible were at risk of being in contempt of court.   16. Additionally, I raised on 15 June 2012 the issue of other individuals who are responsible for publishing this material from outside the jurisdiction, along with those who provide “caching”, “hosting” or search facilities. I indicated to counsel that I needed careful assistance (including possibly expert evidence) as to what,      if any, steps are available to a judge in these circumstances and I asked the prosecution and defence to collaborate as a matter of urgency in order to put me in a position of being able to deal with this aspect of the prejudicial publishing.  17. As an additional step, I asked the prosecution to use every effort to secure voluntary compliance on the part of all concerned, whether within or without the jurisdiction. I invited the Attorney General to assist in the process of inviting Wikipedia to amend the entry on the relevant web page (given internet searches on this subject usually place the Wikipedia entry as one of the first, and at that stage it contained references to the disciplinary proceedings). 18. Finally, on 15 June 2012 I expressed my hope that those responsible for these articles – certainly within the jurisdiction – would comply voluntarily with the spirit of the views that I expressed, given, in the main, they are major broadcasters or publishers.  19. Once the trial began on Monday 18 June 2012, save for some slight delays in removing a small number references to the inadmissible material, broadly speaking the press, Wikipedia, the broadcasters and most “bloggers” had complied with my request. However, two exceptions were later brought to my attention. The Mail Online maintained two articles (certainly for a period during the trial), dated 23 July 2010 [5] and 4 September 2010, as follows: 4 September 2010 PC Harwood, a member of Scotland Yard’s Territorial Support Group, left the Metropolitan Police a decade ago, after an alleged off‐duty road‐rage incident for which he was due to face a misconduct hearing, before instead retiring on medical grounds.   In 2003 he won a job with Surrey Police, where he was accused of using excessive force. He returned to the Met in 2004.  20.  It followed that the only outstanding issue that I needed to address in the closing stages of the trial was what steps, if any, should the court take as regards the stance adopted by Associated Newspapers Limited in failing to comply with the observations I made on 15 June 2012 and the letter that was circulated. Mr Caplan Q.C. submitted that it would be of assistance if the matter could be resolved by way of a formal order.   21. On 16 July 2012 I ordered the removal of the two articles in open court, and I indicated that these reasons would follow.     22. Mr Caplan, who appeared to argue the matter on 5 July 2012, and by reference to his written submissions that principally addressed the application of the strict liability rule, advanced the following principal propositions: i) ii) iii) iv) The Contempt of Court Act 1981 (“CCA”) is concerned with material that is published on a contemporary basis and offered to readers, and this does not cover items that are stored in “an online archive” and which can only be accessed following a specific search.  The remarks of Lord Osborne, set out above [11], when he concluded that material in an online archive was continuously being published for the purposes of the CCA from the moment of publication were obiter and are wrong.  The summary procedure envisaged in Balogh v St Albans Crown Court [13] does not have “any application to the strict liability rule”. It was noted that this authority antedates the Contempt of Court Act and the Human Rights Act 1998, and it was argued that proceedings under the strict liability rule can only be brought by the Attorney General pursuant to section 7. Thereafter, the issue of whether there has been a breach is a value judgment for the Administrative Court. Mr Caplan highlighted that the breach of the strict liability rule (unlike contempts in the face of the court) does not involve an intention to interfere with the course of the trial or the deliberate breach of a court order.   Our system of criminal justice depends on trusting jurors to abide by their oath and any judicial directions. Any interference with freedom expression must be proportionate and necessary (Article 10(2) ECHR). In this regard it was argued that it is neither proportionate nor necessary to require online archives to be sanitised because disobedient jurors might choose to access prejudicial material. Such a requirement would not be practical and it would have a damaging effect on the future of such archives, which are, inter alia, a valuable tool for researchers and academics. Mr Caplan relied on the Law Commission's Scoping Study No 2 (December 2002) on defamation and the internet in which it was indicated \"that it is not practically possible to monitor all criminal trials in the country and subsequently to remove from internet archives any potentially prejudicial material\" (para 5.25). It was suggested that the proportionate response is to direct the jurors not to conduct internet research     regarding the case which they are trying in the same way that they are directed not to discuss the case outside of the jury room.  v) The CCA does not proscribe the publication of prejudicial material simpliciter but only the publication of material that creates a substantial risk of prejudice. The point was made that contemporary publications are to be distinguished from online archives because of the need with the latter to apply search criteria. vi) The Court’s summary powers are not engaged on the facts of this case.  23. On the issue of the steps, if any, that the court should take as regards any material that it considers necessary to diminish the risk that jurors may read inadmissible and prejudicial reports, Mr Caplan submitted that:  […] either the material in question constitutes an anticipated contempt (in which case an application for an injunction to the High Court may be appropriate) or it constitutes an arguable breach of the strict liability rule (in which case it is for the AG to decide whether to institute proceedings and to apply to the High Court). With regard to applications for an injunction, Arlidge Eady and Smith on “Contempt” 4th Ed at paras 6.1 and 6.2 state that it “will generally be inappropriate for trial judges of the Crown Court to entertain applications of this kind … It could rarely be said to be necessary, through pressure of time, to take such a step for the purpose of protecting the integrity of the trial”.    24. Ms Michalos was instructed by the CPS to assist the court on the approach to be taken to the various sources of information that have remained available on the internet, and she highlighted that, for the purposes of the CCA, the main issues are whether any particular site classes as a “publisher” (section 2(1)) and the extent to which the publication creates a substantial risk that the course of justice in question will be seriously impeded or prejudiced (section 2(2)). Additionally, it was pointed out that under section 3(3) it is necessary, for the purposes of strict liability, for the proceedings to have been active at the time of publication.   25. With social networking sites, she expressed the view that those that simply provide a platform for other users (such as Google) are unlikely to be regarded as publishers (but this general statement was somewhat qualified, as set out below). She argued that all sites that are essentially facilitators, such as Facebook and YouTube, are likely to be treated in the same way. Similarly, with search engines and internet service providers (ISPs), she submitted that “the current state of the law strongly suggests that search engines and mere service providers” (e.g. BT and Tiscali who provide access to the internet) “would not be held liable for strict liability contempt because they would not be regarded as publishers”. In the context of defamation, Ms Michalos suggested that at common law if bodies of this kind provide no more than a passive role in facilitating postings on the internet, they are not deemed to be a publisher (Bunt v Tilley [2006] EWHC 407 (QB); [2006] 3 AER 336).  26.  By way of at least a partial qualification to this general submission, Ms Michalos argued that if the ISP is on notice of the material in question then it is possible it will be held to be a publisher, in that in determining responsibility the state of a defendant’s knowledge could be an important factor. My attention was drawn to developing jurisprudence involving Google. In Metropolitan International Schools (t/as Train2Game) v Designtechnica & Google [2009] EWHC 1765 Eady J held that Google was a mere facilitator rather than a publisher, and that “publication” involves a mental element, and this was the case even though Google had taken steps to ensure that certain URLs were blocked: the court held that it was unrealistic to attribute responsibility for publication to Google ([57] and [64]). However, in Davison v Habeeb & others [2011] EWHC 3031, it was decided (HHJ Parkes, sitting as a High Court judge) that it was arguable that Google was a publisher, rather than a mere facilitator, if it was notified that particular material was appearing on a virtual noticeboard for which it was responsible [42]. Eady J returned to this general area in Tamiz v Google Inc [2012] EWHC 449 (QB) when he held that Google Inc. was not a publisher at common law in respect of Google blogs because it was a provider or facilitator. Whilst he held that the mere fact that it had been notified of a complaint did not immediately convert its status or role into that of a publisher ([38]), he indicated that a decision in this area may be fact sensitive ([33]). Eady J set out that liability may turn on the extent to which the relevant ISP has knowledge of the words complained of, their illegality or potential illegality or the extent to which it has control over publication ([33]).  27. On the basis of this material, it was submitted by Ms Michalos that unless there is a reasonably high degree of “active moderation” operated by the site, “it is unlikely that an individual social media site would be held to be a publisher for strict liability purposes. This is because in most cases there will be an absence of the mental element that the authorities suggest is required to render someone a publisher.” However, Ms Michalos suggested that it is arguable that once specific objectionable material has been drawn to the website’s attention, it becomes a publisher for the purposes of strict liability, particularly if – possibly only if – specific material on identified web pages are drawn to the company’s attention.   28. In a similar vein, Ms Michalos argued that a similar approach is likely to apply to any alleged breaches of a section 4(2) order. Her argument is that “(o)nce express knowledge of a court order could be established and attributed to the website, it seems to be that there are better prospects of establishing that a social networking site like Facebook has made a publication in breach of s. 4(2) than for a search engine”. This, it is suggested, is subject to a final determination as to whether a social networking site is to be regarded as a publisher. It is argued that this may be resolved by way of a finding that they are publishers on the basis that the site is providing the means of publication and it has the power to stop it.  29. As to “blogs” and other similar content providers, Ms Michalos drew my attention to certain practical difficulties, which include identifying individual users and the large number that the court would need to deal with. That said, it is suggested that it is clear that an individual user who places material on a webpage or blog plainly publishes the material (see AG v Pelling [2005] EWCH 414 (Admin); [2005] Fam Law 854). 30. Ms Michalos contended that under Regulation 19 of the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002, most providers of services such as Google blogs will have a defence to criminal sanctions for contempt unless there has been effective – meaning highly specific – notification of the objectionable material.  31. Ms Michalos suggested that material published by the general media or in blog publications do not fall within the normal understanding of contempt in the face of the court as they are removed in terms of time and physical proximity. Whilst Ms Michalos accepted in argument that there may be examples of publications that could amount to a contempt of this kind – “for example, media publications in flagrant disregard of court order or during a trial, publication of past convictions in a national newspaper” – she did not accept that the publications here qualify, on the grounds that they are “more removed and historic” and they in many instances would require a search to find the prohibited material.  32. In any event, Ms Michalos contended that in this area it would be preferable, first, to summon the publisher to the Crown Court to explain its stance, and, if the answer is unsatisfactory, thereafter to refer the matter to the Attorney General for prosecution. In particular, she argued that given the difficulties in establishing strict liability contempt as against the various categories of potential contemnor, “it would be unwise to proceed on a summary basis”.  33. As to the powers of the Crown Court, Ms Michalos reminded me that by section 45(4) of the Senior Courts Act 1981: […] the Crown Court shall, in relation to […] any contempt of court, the enforcement of its orders and all other matters incidental to its jurisdiction, have the like powers, rights, privileges and authority as the High Court.         34. Aikens J used this provision when he granted an injunction to restrain a threatened contempt (Ex p. HTV Cymru (Wales) Ltd [2002] EMLR 184).   35. Given the comprehensive research and assistance provided by Ms Michalos, it is useful to set out her overarching conclusion:  In my opinion, if the Court considers that continuing internet publication of historic material is likely to interfere with the administration of justice or  cause  prejudice  to  an  ongoing  trial,  the  proper  course  is  for  an application  to  be  made  for  an  injunction  against  the  relevant  media organisations in the High Court that specifically identifies the material to be enjoined and is not unnecessarily wide. If an injunction were granted and served, this brings with it a potential advantage of being able to bring overseas publishers within the realm of civil contempt if they disobey. It may remain to some extent a theoretical advantage as there would still be  practical  difficulties  with  enforcement.  However,  in  my  experience, reputable corporations beyond the jurisdiction do tend to co‐operate and take down material that is prohibited by a court order.  Discussion and conclusions 36. Although a number of important questions in this general area have been canvassed in the submissions of counsel, I have avoided the temptation of attempting to resolve issues which are, or have become, irrelevant or which have been resolved without the need for any, or any additional, indication or order from the court. As set out above, given the cooperative stance of the media, the only items that I need to address are the two articles that remained on the Mail’s Online website after 18 June 2012. Although one “blog” continued to rehearse elements of the inadmissible material, I have not been provided with any further details about this suggested publication and I have not received any submissions as to how the court should approach the continued availability of this prejudicial information.   Are the two articles in the Mail On line “publications” for the purposes of CCA section 2(1)? 37. Publication is defined in section 2(1) CCA as including “any speech, writing, programme included in a cable programme service or other communication in whatever form, which is addressed to the public at large or any section of the public”. I remain of the view that the words “at the time of the publication” in section 2(3) encompasses the entire period during which the material is available on a website from the moment of its first appearance through to when it was withdrawn (see Her Majesty’s Advocate against William Frederick Ian Beggs supra and Godfrey v Demon Internet Ltd [2001] QB 201 at 208 – 209). The distinction Mr Caplan sought to draw between current and archived reports is less clear than he suggested in argument. Anyone looking for contemporary reports of an ongoing trial will often do so by typing in search terms that are likely to reveal a mix of contemporary and earlier information. The “archived” material, certainly on the Mail’s Online site, remained readily available, and it was revealed by a general search for reports involving PC Harwood or Ian Tomlinson. A juror seeking contemporary information could easily have ended up viewing the reports that included references to the earlier allegations, without necessarily having set out to defy the court’s direction not to conduct research. Accordingly, in my judgment the two articles provided by the Mail Online continued to be “published” whilst the proceedings were active.   Do the two articles in the Mail Online create a substantial risk that the course of justice in the proceedings in question will be seriously impeded or prejudiced? 38. As one of the two central questions in the case (the second was causation), the jury were directed to consider – when determining whether the push was a reasonable use of force – the defendant’s state of mind at the time, and whether his actions were guided by his genuine belief as to what was necessary. At the heart of that question self‐evidently lay the jury’s assessment of the defendant’s honesty (he gave evidence during the trial) and whether his description of only taking such steps as he believed were necessary was truthful. If jurors had accidentally discovered (in the circumstances I have described above) that he had an alleged history of violent and irrational behaviour, their judgment on the issue of his honest belief was likely to have been prejudiced. This was highly damaging material that went directly to one of the two cardinal issues in the case.   39. As I have already indicated, both articles were extremely easy to find on the newspaper’s website, and I have been guided by the line of authority that it is sufficient for a finding of contempt that the court makes the assumption that if the offending publication reached the attention of a juror, this would have created a seriously arguable ground of appeal (see Her Majesty’s Attorney General and Associated Newspapers Ltd and News Group Newspapers Ltd above). As just indicated, a juror looking for contemporary articles on the trial (which is entirely permissible) could, with little effort or by accident, have come across either of these articles, and accordingly I am of the view that their publication constituted a substantial risk of impeding or prejudicing the course of justice. What steps should the court take? 40. The approach to be taken by the court will always depend on the circumstances. It may be appropriate to refer the matter to the Attorney General for a possible prosecution or to suggest to the party that is troubled by the continuing publication that it should consider making an application to the High Court for an   injunction. The circumstances will be infinitely various, but if the Crown Court is to resolve the issue, its ability to deal with matter effectively and fairly is critical. The Crown Court judge will usually have a good understanding of the issues in the case and the likely impact of the information if read by a juror; there may be time constraints, with an impending trial that would be prejudiced if delayed; and this issue will usually be of greatest concern to the defendant who, particularly if funded by the Legal Services Commission, may not be able to meet the costs of an approach to the High Court.   41. The circumstances relating to these two publications were straightforward. The publisher is based in the UK and was readily identifiable; the material complained about was equally clear (two on‐line news articles); I reached conclusions without difficulty, on the basis of my involvement in the case, as to its potential to cause prejudice; and this debate originally occurred in the context of a trial that was about to start, and this particular issue only crystallised whilst it was ongoing. In these circumstances, as trial judge I considered that I was well placed to deal with the problem, and any other remedy was likely to cause delay, expense and prejudice to the defendant and the witnesses (viz. an application to the High Court), or it may be ineffective to prevent prejudice to the trial (viz. a prosecution by the Attorney General). 42. Section 45 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 gives the Crown Court the same power and authority as the High Court as regards any contempt of court. Aikens J in Ex p. HTV Cymru (Wales) Ltd indicated at [23]:  There is no general power in the Crown Court to grant injunctions. But I am satisfied that the Crown Court has the power to grant an injunction to restrain a threatened contempt of court in relation to a matter that is before the Crown Court in question. Whether an injunction should be granted will depend, of course, on whether all the conditions are fulfilled in the case at issue.  43. I am satisfied to the criminal standard that the two publications constitute a contempt of court under the strict liability rule. I am equally certain that issuing an injunction for the relatively short period of this trial was necessary and proportionate, and that in taking this step I was not acting in a way that is incompatible with the right of freedom of expression under Article 10(1) of the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. This order, in my judgment, was necessary under Article 10(2). The means employed (ordering the removal of two articles for a short period of time) was proportionate to the need I have identified (ensuring the fair trial of the accused by avoiding serious prejudice). I had in mind that injunctions of this kind are rarely appropriate, but in the instant case the threat was specific and could be satisfactorily defined, and the failure to grant this injunction ran the risk of far    greater prejudice than if I granted the injunction (to paraphrase Aikens J in Ex p. HTV Cymru (Wales) Ltd [35]).  44. In all the circumstances, on 16 July 2012 I ordered the removal of the two articles. Since the trial is now at a close, it is clearly unnecessary for the Court to consider resorting to its summary contempt powers.        ",

          "context": "  R v. Anthony MANN  SENTENCING REMARKS  by The Hon.  Mr Justice Haddon-Cave Crown Court at Warwickshire Justice Centre – 13th April 2015     Introduction 1.  This is an exceptionally sad and tragic case.    2.  On  20th  June  2014,  the  Defendant,  Mr  Anthony  Mann  (aged  78)  stabbed  his  wife, Janet  Mann  (also  aged  78),  in  the  heart  and  killed  her.  They  had  been  happily married  57  years  and  were  a  devoted  and  loving  couple.  Mrs  Mann,  had  been suffering  for  several  years  with  complex  medical  problems  and  increasing  dementia. Mr Mann had been her constant and devoted carer. Her condition had considerably worsened in the previous days and weeks.  She did not want to return to hospital or to  suffer  any  more.    He  was  under  intolerable  strain  at  the  time  and  acted  under impulse. He called the emergency services and admitted what he had done.  3.  As Counsel for the Prosecution, Mr Grieves-Smith, said in his characteristically fair and balanced opening, context is everything.  Mr Mann, I will turn shortly to outline the context in which you committed this act.  Please remain seated for the moment.   Procedural history  4.  When the case was first listed before the Crown Court a guilty plea to murder was indicated  under  the  Early  Guilty  Plea  scheme.    However,  following  a  conference with  his  client,  Mr  Mann, and the family on 26th September 2014, leading counsel Mr Jonas Hankin QC, sensibly advised that a psychiatric opinion should be obtained as  to  the  potential  question  of  diminished  responsibility.    Mr  Hankin  QC  was  no doubt mindful of R v. Inglis [2011] 1 WLR 1110 (paragraphs [41]-[42]).  5.  The  matter  came  before  me  on  10th  October  2014  and,  after  hearing  helpful submissions from Mr Hankin QC and Mr Grieves-Smith, I granted time for both the Defence  and  Prosecution  to  instruct  suitable  consultant  forensic  psychiatrists  to examine the effects upon Mr Mann’s mental health of his wife’s physical and mental deterioration during the period preceding her death.   6.  I  have  had  the  benefit  of  reading  and  studying  the  reports  of  two  eminent  and experienced  Consultant  Forensic  Psychiatrists:  Dr  Dinesh  Maganty  MBBS FRCPsych  (instructed  by  the  Defence),  and  Dr  J.P.  Kenney-Herbert  MBBS FRANZCP  MRCPsych  (instructed  by  the  Prosecution).  Dr  Maganty  and  Dr  Psychiatric reports   1Kenney-Herbert are ad idem:  at the time, Mr Mann, you killed his wife, you were suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning brought about by a combination of  a  moderate  depressive  episode  (or  adjustment  disorder)  combined  with  enforced insomnia,  due  to  your  round-the-clock  caring  responsibilities  for  your  wife,  which substantially impaired your ability to make rational judgments.  I am grateful to both doctors for their lucid and powerful reports.    7.  Dr Maganty referred, insightfully, to the “perfect storm of events” which led tragically to you doing what you did that night.  8.  First and foremost was the deteriorating physical and mental health of your dear wife, Janet. She had suffered medical problems for a long time. In 2008, she was admitted to hospital to remove some piles but due to a urinary infection had to be fitted with a catheter. She found this traumatic and difficult to endure. She complained of pains all down her legs and not being able to sit down and of her skin being ‘on fire’ and not wanting to wear any clothes as a result. Attempts were made to pinpoint the problem and ameliorate the symptoms but without much success, although by 2012 the pain had stabilised somewhat. However, by this time Janet began to suffer from memory loss and the onset of dementia, which included her being unable to recall how to use light switches or to wash.   9.  Second,  was  the  death  of  your  brother  (and  her  brother-in-law),  Roger,  which caused her physical and mental health to deteriorate significantly. She was admitted to hospital on 7th May 2014 in a considerable state of distress rocking back and forth, crying and wailing.  She remained in hospital until 20th May 2014 and whilst there she  said  word  to  the  effect  of  “I  don’t  want  to  live  like  this”  or  “I  don’t  want  to  live anymore”.  She was re-admitted to hospitable on 1st June until 11th June 2014.  Due to  problems  with  her  catheter  which  caused  her  great  pain  and  distress,  Janet  was then  returned  to  hospital  on  12th  to  13th  June  and  again  on  14th  June  2014.    She pulled out several catheters.  10. Third, from the very beginning of these medical problems in 2008, you had been a most  devoted  and  assiduous  carer  for  your  wife,  Janet.  From  2012,  this  effectively became  a  full  time  job:  washing  her,  preparing  special  purée  foods  for  her, accompanying  her  to  the  toilet  (at  least  ‘twenty  times’  a  day),  and  making  sure  she was comfortable at night. You slept on a sofa for six years because your movements on  the  bed  made  her  pain  worse.    You  rarely  had  more  than  3  hours  sleep  at  a stretch.  You wanted to remain close at hand.  11. Fourth, you were described as very “stoical” and “a proud man” who felt that it was your  duty  to  care  for  your  wife  Janet  yourself.  You  were  never  head  to  complain, however difficult it was. Your daughters, Michelle Holmes and Elaine Hassall, visited regularly.  You  are  blessed  with  a  close  and  loving  family.  There  was  community nursing support. But you effectively became homebound to look after your wife as her main carer. And it is clear that you tried your best to cope on a daily basis in very difficult  circumstances,  including  her  regular  manifestations  of  pain  and  distress  and her  confusions.    You  almost  certainly  did  not  appreciate  the  physical  and  mental strain and toll that all this was having on you. It was only latterly, on 18th and 19th June, when things began to deteriorate very seriously, did you begin to ask for extra help  from  social  services.  It  is  significant,  as  Dr  Maganty  has  pointed  out,  that  you had not slept for 24 hours before the night in question.    2  Events of 20th June 2014  12. You called 999 at 02.20 hours on 20th June 2014 and told the call handler “I  have just killed my wife”. You said “she’s in dementia; she’s not slept for two days and she’s very very  distressed  telling  me  to  help  her  to  go”.  The  police  arrived  at  your  house  in Nuneaton in 4 minutes and you showed them to the downstairs bedroom and said “I hope she’s gone.”  The police found your wife lying on her back in bed with an 11 cm kitchen knife sticking out of her upper abdomen, just below the rib cage. You said “I gave her her medication tonight, she has been struggling to go to the toilet, she was asking me to help her and said that I had promised.”  You explained what you had done and told the officer ”I was in the Army.  I was taught to do it properly”.    13. The  post  mortem  evidence  suggested  that  she  would  have  died  quickly.  You  were arrested and taken to the police station. You explained in interview how your wife’s condition  and  ability  to  cope  with  her  catheter  had  been  rapidly  deteriorating  and that the previous two days had been particularly bad. You explained “she’s never been as bad as this; she’s never never screamed, it was like a howl”.  She said did not want to go on or go to hospital and had spat out the sleeping pills you gave her and was trying to pull out the catheter again. You explained how at this point “I went into the kitchen and she was screaming, howling. I thought God Janet and that’s when I did it.” You said “I walked  straight  in  and  stabbed  her  and  that’s  it  finished.    I  put  some  new  underwear  on [her]… and kissed her and said I love you.”  14. Mrs Mann’s death was caused by a single directed thrust into heart. There were no defensive injuries or injuries to indicate forceful restraint or resistance. Death would have occurred rapidly.  Psychiatric reports conclusions – diminished responsibility  15. Dr Maganty stated in the conclusion to his report:  “3.  Mr  Mann,  at  the  material  time  of  the  index  offence,  was  suffering  with  a  moderate depressive  episode,  which  is  a  mental  disorder  within  the  meaning  of  the  Mental  Health  Act 1983  (amended  2007).  This  combined  with  enforced  insomnia  due  to  his  round  the  clock caring responsibility would individually and in combination constitute an abnormality of mental functioning.  A  moderate  depressive  disorder  is  a  recognised  medical  condition.  Mr  Mann’s moderate depressive episode together with the concurrent insomnia affected his rational judgment at the material time and his ability to exercise self-control. Mr Mann was a devoted husband and cared and supported his wife, Janet Mann, on a round the clock basis for years. His love and  care  for  her  has  not  been  questioned  by  the  numerous  individuals  that  have  provided witness statements and also have come into contact with the couple. Unfortunately this led to underestimation of her care needs and his ability to provide the care due to his unquestioning devotion to her. His psychological makeup, which led him to take a position that he did not want  to  “put  on  to  others”  what  he  saw  as  his  duty  to  care  for  his  wife,  led  to  reduced professional  care  for  his  wife  and  him.  In  my  opinion,  I  could  no  identify  any  other  more probable  explanation  for  the  killing  other  than  his  moderate  depressive  episode  affection  his rational judgment and his exercise of self-control leading the index offence. In my opinion, his moderate depressive episode in the circumstances outlined above would provide an explanation for the killing. In my opinion his moderate depressive was a significant contributing factor to the killing.”   3   16. Dr Kenney-Herbert stated in the conclusion to his report:  “87. Mr Mann in many ways underplays the burden of looking after his wife and the effects upon  on  physically  and  psychologically.  To  this  end  it  is  difficult  to  gain  a  clear  history  in details from him regarding his psychological and mental health leading up to the alleged index offence.  However,  based  on  all  the  available  information,  I  think  it  is  highly  likely  he  was suffering from an abnormal mental state at the time of the alleged index offence. He had not slept  for  days  and  this  was  with  a  background  of  chronic  poor  sleep.  He  had  lost  weight  and described  to  Dr  Maganty  feeling  low  in  mood.  He  is  unable  to  grasp  the  complexities  of  his wife’s  situation  and  does  in  particular  focus  that  all  the  problems  were  somehow  related  to  a fractured coccyx from many years ago. It is clear from the information I have seen no-one told him that this was the cause of all her problems. It would appear at the time of the alleged index offence he saw no way forward other than to do what Janet Mann from his perspective wanted him  to  do  and  that  was  to  end  her  suffering  and  to  honour  their  agreement  to  do  so  in  such circumstances. This may present a moderate depressive episode; it could also be described as an adjustment disorder.”  17. I accept both their reports and conclusions. I am also satisfied that, not only did you love  your  wife  very  much,  but  you  were  at  the  time  under  the  most  unbearable strain and suffering from the abnormality of mind described by Dr Maganty and Dr Kenney-Herbert  in  their  reports.  The  use  of  a  knife  to  kill  your  wife  in  this  way exceptional,  but  perhaps  symptomatic  of  your  desperation  in  the  heat  of  the moment. You had not forgotten your training in the Army and knew how to use a knife. As I have said, I am satisfied that you acted on impulse.  18. Mr Grieves-Smith had indicated that, in view of the context and the evidence in this case, the Prosecution will accept a plea to manslaughter in this case on the grounds of diminished  responsibility.    In  my  judgment,  in  the  light  of  the  facts  and  evidence which I have outlined, it is entirely right and appropriate that the Prosecution should do so and I sentence on that basis.  Principles   19. I  have  considered  the  authorities  including,  in  particular,  R  v.  Leslie  Susan  Higgins [1996]  1  Cr  App  R  (S)  271,  R  v  Chambers  5  Cr.  App.  R.  (S)  190),  Attorney General’s  Reference  No.83  of  2009  (Patrick  John  Andrew  Moore)  [2010]  2 Cr.App.R.(S.) 26 at 161, R v Webb  [2011] 2 Cr. App. R. (S) 61, R. v Beaver (Peter Richard) [CACD 24 March 2015, unreported]).  In the light of the authorities, it seems to me that the principles to be applied when sentencing in cases of manslaughter by diminished responsibility such as the present are as follows: (1)  The  fundamental  principle  of  the  sanctity  of  human  life  is  always  to  be respected and reflected in the sentence passed.  (2)  The  culpability  of  the  defendant  in  diminished  responsibility  manslaughter cases may sometimes be reduced almost to extinction, whilst in others it may remain very high.  Each case will depend on its own particular facts. (3) Subject  to  the  specific  element  of  reduced  culpability  inherent  in  the defence, the assessment of the seriousness of the instant offence of diminished    4responsibility  manslaughter  should  have  regard  to  the  guidance  in  Schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003. In  assessing  the  seriousness  of  a  killing  consequent  on  manslaughter  rather than  murder,  regard  should  be  had  to  the  criteria  for  determining  the minimum term to be served in murder cases and then to reduce the sentence to allow for the extent to which the culpability of the offender was reduced by his or her mental condition. In diminished responsibility cases, there are various courses open to a judge. In  cases  where  the  evidence  indicates  that  the  responsibility  of  the  accused for his acts was so grossly impaired that his degree of responsibility for them was minimal, a lenient course will be open to the judge. Provided that there is no danger of repetition of violence, it will usually be possible to make such an  order  as  will  give  the  accused  his  freedom,  possibly  with  some supervision. It is of central importance that a court must not overlook the feelings of the family  of  the  deceased.  It  is  of  the  greatest  importance  that  those  feelings should be respected. (4)  (5) (6) (7) In an appropriate case, the principle of the sanctity of human life would not be undermined if an immediate custodial sentence was not imposed.   Analysis  20. As I said at the beginning, this is an exceptionally sad and tragic case. I am satisfied that the night you killed your wife and were under the most extreme pressure and suffering from an abnormality of mind as described.    21. This  case  has  some  features  in  common  with  R  v.  Webb  (supra)  and  the  following observations of Lord Judge LCJ are pertinent: “24.  On any view this was an exceptionally difficult sentencing exercise. The killing of Mrs Webb was, and will always be, the  result of an unlawful act. On the basis of diminished  responsibility  it  was  not  murder,  but  manslaughter  committed  as  a  mercy killing intended by the appellant to help his wife achieve her settled intention to end her own life, notwithstanding his pleas to her that she should not do so. In our judgment his actions in this case came very close to the offence of assisting in his wife's intended suicide, acting as he did to fulfil her clear, unequivocal wishes to end her life, so that when she failed to achieve what she wanted, he took over from her. 25.  All  this  must  be  set  in  the  context  of  a  man  whose  responsibility,  if  not altogether extinguished, was substantially reduced. We accept the submission that if he had  not  been  in  the  situation  in  which  he  was  and  suffering  from  the  condition  from which he did suffer, it is most unlikely that this killing would have occurred. We remind ourselves of the turmoil which he must have suffered as he committed the last fatal act. 26.  The  appellant  has  now  served  the  equivalent  of  a  sentence  of  six  months' imprisonment. In the unusual and particular circumstances of this case we do not believe that  the  principle  of  the  sanctity  of  human  life  would  be  undermined  if  the  sentence imposed  on  the  appellant  were  now  reduced  to  one  of  twelve  months'  imprisonment, suspended, so that this lonely old man may receive the help that he will need to come to terms with the disaster that has overtaken him.” 5      22. In  R  v.  Webb  (supra),  the  Court  of  Appeal  quashed  the  order  of  immediate imprisonment  and  substituted  an  order  of  twelve  months'  imprisonment  suspended for twelve months and attached a supervision order.  23. R v. Webb was recently considered and applied in R. v Beaver (Peter Richard) (CACD 24  March  2015,  unreported),  on  facts  striking  similar  to  the  present  (although  Beaver could not be described as a case of mercy killing).  The Court of Appeal in that case quashed a sentence of imprisonment of three years and substituted a sentence of two years suspended for two years, with conditions.  Defence submissions  24. I am grateful to Mr Hankin QC for his measured and helpful submissions.  I accept his  central  submission  that  your  responsibility,  Mr  Mann,  for  killing  hour  wife  is substantially  reduced,  if  not  altogether  extinguished,    by  virtue  of  the  depressive episode and adjustment disorder from which you was suffering at the material time. If you had not been in the situation in which you were was and suffering from the condition from which he did suffer, it is most unlikely that this killing would have occurred.   25. I  also  accept,  in  the  light  of  all  the  evidence,  that  your  residual  culpability  was minimal. You are selfless and decent man and devoted to your wife and were, to a large  extent  motivated,  by  a  desire  to  alleviate  your  wife’s  suffering  and  to  honour what  you  saw  as  your  commitment  that  you  should  do  so.  You  were  appalled  by what, cruelly, she was having to endure. You felt were driven to act as he did.   I repeat  that  the  act  of  killing  was  an  impulsive  one,  committed  under  extraordinary stress.   26. Mr Hankin QC rightly acknowledges this was not a case of assisted suicide. It was, rather, a case of ‘mercy killing’ by manslaughter. It is right to acknowledge, however, that this is compelling evidence that Mrs Mann had wanted her suffering to end: (1)  Mrs Mann repeatedly told you that she didn’t want “to go on”. As presaged above,  when  asked  during  the  999  call  why  he  had  killed  his  wife  the defendant said “she’s very, very distressed, telling me to help her go…she asked me for days”. In interview, when explaining why you waited some time before calling the police (to ensure your could not be revived) you said  “she didn’t want  to  come  back,  I  knew  that,  she  didn’t  want  to  come  back…when  we  were younger we always said we’d look after each other…she said ‘I don’t want to live like this’…you’ll help me’”. (2)  During  Mrs  Mann  time  in  hospital  in  May  2014,  she  was  heard  by  her daughter,  Michelle  Holmes,  to  say  “I  don’t  want  to  live  like  this  anymore”. Michelle Holmes also reports that on the 17th June Mrs Mann, when she was crying in agony, said to her “I don’t want to live like this…I don’t want to live anymore”.  (3)  Mrs Mann’s other daughter Elaine Hassall says that she told her “I can’t live like this” and “I don’t want to live like this” many times in May and June.        6(4)  Your  sister  Maxine  Jardine  also  reports  that  during  the  same  period  Mrs. Mann  said  to  her  “I  don’t  want  to  live  like  this,  this  isn’t  living”  and  on  one occasion while in hospital said “I want to die”.  27. As  Mr  Hankin  QC  has  rightly  emphasised,  an  indication  of  how  great  was  the burden was on you that neither daughter, Michelle Holmes or Elaine Hassall, bears any  resentment  towards  him;  indeed  each  expresses  their  relief  that  their  mother’s suffering has ended. As Mr Grieves-Smith has highlighted, both have spoken of you, their father, in the most glowing terms and spoken movingly of the privations your wife suffered and your devoted care for her.   28. Michelle Holmes said in her statement to the Court:   “I  was  devastated  by  the  news  but  in  some  ways  felt  great  relief.  Mum  was  no  longer suffering or in pain and it felt like at last she was at peace as she had been suffering for so long. Immediately I had no hard feelings to my dad. I only felt love, support and gratitude to him…Dad provided mum with amazing care and utter devotion and we are glad of how he cared for her. All our family support him and want him home, none of us feels any ill will towards him.”   29. Elaine Hassall said in her statement to the Court:  “I hold no ill feelings towards dad and fully support him. I understand that he loved her and  did  it  for  her…I  love  my  dad,  I  support  my  dad,  I  support  what  he  has  done.  He adored mum and only did what he did out of love. We do not want him to be in prison, we want him home with us”.  Mitigation  30. You are now 78 years old. You were born in Nuneaton and have lived there all your life.  You  met  your  wife  at  a  dance  when  you  were  seventeen  and  since  then  have never spent much time apart, save for you stint on National Service. You have led an exemplary  life.    After  National  Service  you  worked  as  a  mechanic  in  the  motor industry before joining the Coal Board. You and your late wife were very much part of the local community and had a strong network of friends. You and Janet enjoyed many  activities  together  including  ballroom  dancing,  gardening  and  cycling.    You and  your  wife  did  voluntary  work  for  a  number  of  years  at  the  George  Elliot Hospital  and  for  a  local  cancer  charity.  Your  have  been  described  you  as  a  “very devoted father and husband” and as a very generous person who would “do anything for anyone”.  You have a close and loving family who do not blame you for what you have done.    31. You  are  a  man  in  your  late  seventies.  You  are  someone  of  positive  good  character with an impeccable employment record and a long history of voluntary work.  You have  led  an  industrious,  hardworking  and  decent  life.  You  have  been  devoted  to your wife and family.   32. I  have  been  provided  with  a  file  overflowing  with  testimonials  from  friends, neighbours, acquaintances from all walks of life, many of whom have know you and your wife, Janet, for 30 years or more, who speak eloquently about the strength of your marriage and what a kind, caring couple you were. They speak poignantly and movingly  about  the  years  of  devoted  care  you  gave  to  your  wife.    They  speak  of  7your  kindness  and  generosity  to  everyone  you  met.  I  quote  from  one  letter,    in particular, by way of example: “The best way of describing Tony would be say that he is a prime example of a PERFECT ENGLISH GENTLEMAN. Over the years, he and his wife were inseparable.  He adored her.”    33. In  my  judgment,  in  the  exceptional  circumstances  of  this  case,  an  immediate custodial sentence for manslaughter is not required. This case is at the lowest end of culpability. Your daughters and other family members have clear and unequivocally expressed  the  wish  that  you  (and  they)  do  not  suffer  further  by  you  being  sent  to prison.  This  seems  to  me  to  be  a  paradigm  case  for  leniency  and  mercy.  The principle  of  the  sanctity  of  human  life  would  not  be  undermined  if  the  sentence imposed on you were to be suspended.     34. There is no public interest or need to send you to prison.  I am satisfied that, given the exceptional circumstances of this case, and whilst mindful of the need to reflect the sanctity of human life, this case can nevertheless properly be dealt with by way of a Suspended Sentence Order.  35. You reported what you had done and fully assisted the police in their enquiries into the  circumstances  of  his  wife’s  death.  You  pleaded  guilty  at  the  first  opportunity. You do not pose a danger to the public in any way. I am satisfied that is not a case where  any  form  of  supervision  is  necessary.  The  recent  amendments  to  the suspended  sentence  provisions  by  LASPOA  2012  now  allow  for  a  suspended sentence for up to two year’s duration and for a sentence to be suspended without any community requirements being attached to that sentence (c.f. Archbold 5-538).  Sentence  36. Mr Mann, please stand up. You have pleaded not guilty today to murder but guilty to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. That is a plea with the Court accepts. For this offence, for the reasons I have given, the sentence which I impose is a  sentence  of  two  years  imprisonment,  suspended  for  two  years.  The  usual  victim surcharge order applies.  37. I  am  grateful  to  Mr  Grieves-Smith  and  Mr  Hankin  QC  for  their  able  assistance today.  8",

          "context": "  R  v  Peter Johnson Jonathan Mathew Jay Vijay Merchant and Alex Pabon  Sentencing Remarks of HHJ Anthony Leonard QC  Southwark Crown Court  8th July 2016 On 3rd October 2014 you, Peter Johnson, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud.    It  was  a  courageous  decision  and  in  what  is  the  third  trial involving  Libor,  you  are  the  first  defendant  to  enter  a  plea  of  guilty.  After a trial lasting just under three months the jury returned verdicts of guilty  against  you,  Jonathan  Mathew,  Jay  Merchant  and  Alex  Pabon.  You  do  not  receive  any  additional  sentence  because  you  decided  to contest the charge but you each lost the benefit which will be afforded to Johnson for his plea of guilty. This  prosecution,  put  shortly,  has  centred  on  you  as  Libor  submitters and  US  Dollar  traders  getting  together  to  manipulate  the  market  for your own benefit and, as a consequence, to the benefit of Barclays Bank.  You did it to improve the position on your own books knowing that was bound  to  cause  loss  to  the  counterparties.    That  was  because  each transaction  involved  a  zero  sum  gain;  whatever  you  gained,  the counterparty lost. The  actual  benefit  to  each  of  you  in  terms  of  an  increased  bonus  was small and is impossible to estimate.   I do not judge that was your true motivation.  However retaining your job or being promoted to the next level  at  the  bank  did  depend  on  making  a  profit  on  your  book, something which was under daily scrutiny at the bank.   1  1. 2. 3.  4. Each of you earned or could have earned in the future, if your career had flourished, very significant amounts of money: Johnson: your  income  and  bonus  rose  from  £630,000  in  2005  to £1,205,000 in 2007. Mathew: Your  income  rose  from  £109,500  in  2005  to  £280,750  in 2007. Merchant:  In 2005 your total income was £700,000 and by 2007 your annual salary and bonus reached £2,209,831. Pabon: In the full year 2005 you earned £183,933 and in the short period  you  worked  for  Barclays  in  2006  you  earned  a further £40,454.  5. 6. 7. It is clear from your annual self-assessments and from what you said in evidence that in your case, Mathew, you hoped for promotion.  In fact, when Johnson was promoted within the bank, you took over from him.  I  have  no  doubt  that  you  hoped  to  earn  as  much  as  he  did  in  the  long term. In  your  case,  Pabon,  I  am  satisfied  that  you  had  the  same  incentive  to improve  your  position  and  your  income.    However,  your  realisation  of what  Gourtay  and  your  own  trading  had  cost  Barclays  together  with finding yourself burnt out by the job, led you to think about leaving by March 2006, and doing so shortly afterwards.  It follows that both your income and your involvement in the fraud was less than that of your co-defendants, and that will be reflected in your sentence. I judge that there was a further factor which persuaded each of you on the dollar trading desk to manipulate the rates, and that was a desire to play the markets whilst influencing the result.  Trading was all about a fraction of a basis point here and a fraction there.  8. In  sentencing  Hayes,  Mr  Justice  Cooke  considered  that  it  was  hard  to overstate the seriousness of his conduct and observed that “High  standards  of  probity  are  to  be  expected  of  those  who operate  in  the  banking  system,  whether  they  are  bankers  in dealing  with  deposits  and  the  lending  of  money  or  traders  in  an investment  banking  context.    What  this  case  has  shown  is  the absence of that integrity that ought to characterise banking.”  29. 11. 12. 13. I respectfully agree with his remarks and add that the City has become a very  different  place  over  recent  years.    Sally  Scutt,  the  Deputy  Chief Executive of the British Bankers’ Association, said in evidence that when the  Financial  Services  and  Markets  Act  2000  came  into  force,  the  City moved away from an era where the motto of the City had been \"my word is  my  bond\".    She  said  that  it  was  beyond  people's  imagination  that anyone would deliberately abuse the Libor definition and use it for their own  purposes,  rather  than  for  the  public  good  and  to  ensure  that  the market ran in a professional way.  She said that there was a level of trust and  the  purpose  of  the  Libor  definition  was  not  to  take  one’s  own commercial interests into consideration. 10.  By their verdicts the jury has characterised your behaviour as dishonest as you must have known that it was. I  have  been  asked  to  consider  your  offending  as  being  in  a  different category  to  that  of  Hayes.    I  agree  that  there  are  real  and  significant differences  between  his  criminality  and  that  which  was  alleged  against you  collectively.   It  explains  why  the  sentencing  judge  imposed consecutive  sentences  which  took  his  total  sentence  to  14  years.  Although  that  was  reduced  on  appeal  to  11  years,  the  Court  of  Appeal accepted that his culpability was high, the harm serious and a deterrent element was plainly required.  They reduced the sentence to eight years on  the  charges  of  fraud  and  three  years  consecutive  in  relation  to another offence of conspiracy to defraud to take account of his age, non-managerial position and mild Asperger’s condition. In considering the appropriate sentences in respect of each of you, I am faced  by  the  same  difficulty  that  Mr  Justice  Cooke  faced,  that  the maximum  sentence  for  fraud  is  ten  years,  and  the  starting  point  for  a loss  of  £1  million  is  seven  years  which  leads  to  little  room  for differentiating between fraud involving loss in that amount and one that involves losses calculated the millions or in which the reputational effect of the fraud is grave. I  have  considered  the  Sentencing  Guidelines.    I  will  address  issues  of culpability and personal circumstances later, but first will deal generally with the question of loss caused or intended in respect of Harm A in the Definitive Guidelines.  It has been argued, in particular by Mr Davies QC on behalf of Merchant but adopted by others, that the loss or risk of loss ought  to  fall  into  category  3  or,  possibly  2  at  the  highest.    The submissions  are  based  on  the  fact  that  it  has  been  impossible  to calculate  the  actual  loss  in  this  case,  and  that  attempts  to  do  so  have produced  figures  which,  at  the  absolute  maximum,  come  to  $553,000 for the whole period.  In respect of Pabon, Mr Allen QC identifies that he  314. 15. 16. 17. 19. was  a  party  to  the  fraud  for  a  period  of  about  eight  months  and  the figure for him must be significantly less than that. In  my  judgment  the  actual  loss  or  risk  of  loss  does  not  realistically identify the harm caused by the criminal conduct in this case.  I am left in no doubt that you were all, for varying amounts of time, involved in a deliberate  plan  to  manipulate  the  rates  for  your  benefit  and  that  of Barclays as I have described. To  what  extent  you  caused  loss  to  others  was  dependent  on  factors outside your control.  It depended  largely on the Libor Rate submitted by the other 15 banks contributing to the setting of the Libor Rate and whether the rate put forward by Barclays was within the pack or at the extreme of the range where it could have most impact, together with the calculation  by  you,  Johnson,  and  by  you,  Mathew,  as  to  what  rate  you could submit without it being apparent that it was outside the range to such an extent that it might attract comment. It follows that I have no doubt that on each occasion that you as Dollar traders  asked  the  submitters  to  put  in  a  particular  rate,  or  indeed  to keep  it  unchanged,  it  was  done  to  cause  you  maximum  benefit  and, therefore, the counterparties maximum loss.  Whether it did so, and to what extent, was largely in the hands of others. I have concluded that the risk of loss can be judged to run into millions of pounds and, in accordance with the guidelines, falls within category 2 of  Harm  A.    Harm  B  does  not  apply  to  this  case  and  no  adjustment needs to be made. 18.  But in considering the appropriate sentence I need to have regard to any aggravating  features.    One  that  applies  to  you  all  is  the  undeniable evidence of community and wider impact.  Whether or not it continued to be used after Libor rigging became common knowledge, the effect on confidence  in  and  the  integrity  of  a  market  rate  which  is  relied  upon globally is at the heart of your criminality.   In assessing what effect that has on sentence I note that, whereas other guidelines  refer  to  factors  increasing  seriousness  resulting  in  an adjustment to sentence within the range (or within the range or where appropriate  outside  the  identified  category  range),  these  guidelines purposely state that I should identify whether any combination of these or any other relevant factors should result in \"an upward or downward adjustment  from  the  sentence  arrived  at  so  far”.    That  flexibility  is designed  to  cope  with  a  case  such  as  this  where  reputational  damage may be greater than provable loss.  420. I have been asked to take into account that other traders have escaped criminal  prosecution  in  this  country  and  abroad  and  the  way  in  which two  traders  have  been  treated  by  the  American  courts.    I  decline  to  do so.    In  my  judgment  I  must  sentence  on  the  basis  of  the  criminality proved  against  you  and  in  accordance  with  the  sentencing  regime applicable in this country. 21.  You  are  each  of  good  character,  not  only  in  the  sense  of  having  no convictions but having positive good characters and I will take that into account in respect of each of you.  In respect of those to whom it applies, I  have  taken  into  account  what  was  said  or  written  about  you  by  the character  witnesses  who  were  called  in  the  trial  as  well  as  the  further references which I have been provided with.  I will take all that material into account in passing sentence. 22.  Although the period from charge to trial has been comparatively short I will, to some extent, take the time between the offences and the verdicts, being up to 11 years, into account.  23. I will now deal with each of you in turn.  I intend to start with you, Jay Merchant.    Because  I  accept  the  argument  put  forward  on  behalf  of Johnson and Mathew, that, although they were responsible for the Libor submissions,  it  was  only  in  response  to  the  requests  of  the  Dollar traders,  I  judge  you,  of  all  the  defendants,  to  bear  the  greatest responsibility for what happened. 24.  The  evidence  of  the  way  in  which  manipulation  of  the  rate  began  in earnest after you arrived in New York was compelling.  I do not suggest that you were the originator of the scheme, and it may well be that you got  the  idea  from  Fred  Gourtay  who  had  arrived  shortly  before  from another  bank.    It  was  under  your  leadership  on  the  desk  that  the requests to the Libor submitters really took off. 25.  On  the  evidence  put  before  jury,  I  do  not  judge  that  there  was  any manipulation being carried out by traders on other desks before it began on the New York Dollar desk.  Extensive searches of the unused material has  failed  to  turn  up  any  evidence  of  a  pre-existing  practice  of manipulation.  If there was, it must have been insignificant and Mathew, sitting at the cash desk was unaware of it. 26. In  respect  of  culpability,  your  offending  falls  into  Category  A,  “High Culpability”.  You played a leading rôle in that: (a) You abused a position of power, trust and responsibility,   5(b)  Although the part of your day taken up by making the request or getting others to make the request on your behalf may have been  comparatively  small,  it  required  you  to  make  careful involved calculations  of  what  the  rate  should  be  and sophistication and planning. (c) The  offending  was  carried  out  of  over  a  significant  period  of time, and (d)  There was a large number of victims. 27.  Together  with  my  finding  in  respect  of  the  harm  and  impact  of  your offending, that takes my sentence up to 8 years before considering any mitigating factors. 28.  You are in your mid 40’s.  In addition to what I heard about you during the trial, and which included your charitable acts, I take into account the references I was provided with.  I take into account that you may have to serve your sentence in this country because you do not have American citizenship  and  I  will  make  a  specific  further  reduction  in  your  case  to take that into account.  This conviction may affect your ability to obtain citizenship hereafter, and I am mindful  of that.  I take into account all that  has  been  said  on  your  behalf  and  in  particular  the  effect  on  your young family of your absence. 29.  Peter Johnson; in terms of culpability, you fit squarely into the bracket of “High Culpability” in that: (a) (b) (c) You  played  a  leading  rôle  as  the  senior  submitter  for  Dollar Libor I  judge  that  you  were  responsible  for  involving  Mathew,  not through  pressure  applied  on  him,  but  by  your  influence  over him as his mentor and senior. You abused your position of trust as the Libor submitter who should  have  put  in  a  rate  uninfluenced  by  the  requests  of  the traders. (d)  Although  the  part  of  your  day  taken  up  by  calculating  how  to respond  to  the  requests  made  of  you  when  submitting  the Libor Rate may have been comparatively small, it required you to  make  careful  calculations  of  what  the  rate  should  be  and involved sophistication and planning.   6(e) The  offending  was  carried  out  of  over  a  significant  period  of time, and (f) There was a large number of victims. 30.  Together  with  my  finding  in  respect  of  the  harm  and  impact  of  your offending,  and  acknowledging  that  yours  was  a  pivotal  rôle,  that  takes my sentence up to 7½  years before considering any mitigating factors. 31. 32. You are 61 years old.  I have read the many character references which attest to your good character and paint a picture of a caring family man, exceptionally generous with your time and with practical and emotional support to friends and those in need.  You have made use of your time since  leaving  Barclays  to  give  of  your  practical  skills  to  the  National Trust.  I have also taken into account what has been said about you as a banker by Mark Dearlove.  I take into account the effect that your plea of guilty has had on your personal and financial circumstances and all that has been said on your behalf. In addition to the time that has passed since the start of your offending, I will also take into account the time you have spent awaiting sentence through no fault of you own.  You have waited 20 months to know what sentence will be passed on you.  That amounts to a sentence in itself and I shall give you a further significant reduction in addition to that which you  will  receive  for  your  plea  of  guilty  to  reflect  the  trauma  you  have faced during that time. 33. Jonathan  Mathew:  in  terms  of  culpability,  you  fit  into  the  bracket  of “High Culpability” in that: (a) You abused your position of trust as the Libor submitter who should  have  put  in  a  rate  uninfluenced  by  the  requests  of  the traders. (b)  Although  the  part  of  your  day  taken  up  by  calculating  how  to respond  to  the  requests  made  of  you  when  submitting  the Libor Rate may have been comparatively small, it required you to  make  careful  calculations  of  what  the  rate  should  be  and involved sophistication and planning. (c) The  offending  was  carried  out  of  over  a  significant  period  of time, and (d)  There was a large number of victims.  734.  Together  with  my  finding  in  respect  of  the  harm  and  impact  of  your offending, but acknowledging your limited rôle standing in for Johnson when he was not in the office or assisting him when he was there, that the number of submissions you made was considerably less than those made  by  Johnson  and  that  you  were  led  into  this  offending,  albeit voluntarily  by  Johnson,  that  takes  my  sentence  to  5  years  before considering any mitigating factors. 35.  You are 35 years old.  I take into  account everything that your counsel has  said  on  your  behalf  and  in  particular  the  consequences  of  this prosecution on you and your family financially and emotionally.  I have read the additional letters of support from a friend and members of your family. 36.  Alex  Pabon:  in  terms  of  culpability,  you  fit  into  the  bracket  of  “High Culpability” in that: (a) You  abused  your  position  of  trust  as  a  trader  to  influence  the Libor Rate which was submitted. (b)  Although the part of your day taken up by making the request or getting others to make the request on your behalf may have been  comparatively  small,  it  required  you  to  make  careful involved calculations  of  what  the  rate  should  be  and sophistication and planning. (c) The  offending  was  carried  out  of  over  a  significant  period  of time  but  I  acknowledge  that  it  was  for  a  significantly  shorter time that Merchant, and (d)  There was a large number of victims. 37.  Together  with  my  finding  in  respect  of  the  harm  and  impact  of  your offending,  but  acknowledging  your  subordinate  rôle  and  the  short period  over  which  you  were  a  party  to  the  conspiracy  that  takes  my sentence  to  4  years  before  considering  any  mitigating  factors.    In reaching that sentence I have had in mind that the reason that you left banking  had  nothing  to  do  with  any  realisation  on  your  part  that  you should not pursue this fraudulent and dishonest conduct.  38.  You are now aged 37.  I take into account everything that has been said on  your  behalf  and  in  particular  the  effect  on  your  family  of  losing  the primary  carer  for  your  son,  your  father’s  physical  position,  the  overall effect on your family and you personally of this conviction.  I shall make  8a  small  extra  reduction  to  reflect  that  you  may  serve  part  of  your sentence in this country remote from your family. 39.  You will serve one half of the sentences I am about to pass in custody.  You will then be released on licence for the remainder of your sentence.  While  you  are  on  licence  you  must  comply  with  its  conditions  and commit  no  further  offence  or  you  will  be  liable  to  be  recalled  and  you will then serve the remainder of your sentence in custody. 40.  The surcharge provisions apply to this case and the orders will be drawn up accordingly.   41.  The offence is so serious that only a custodial sentence can be justified and  the  least  possible  sentence  I  can  impose  having  regard  to  the aggravating  and  mitigating  factors  of  the  case  which  I  have  set  out together with everything that your counsel has said on your behalf are as follows:- Peter  Johnson:  I  reduce  your  sentence  to  reflect  your  personal circumstances,  the  period  of  time  which  has  elapsed  since  your offending, and the time you have waited to be sentenced by 18 months to which I apply a one third reduction for your plea of guilty.  You will go to prison for 4 years Jonathan Mathew: you will go to prison for 4 years. Jay Vijay Merchant: you will go to prison for 6½ years. Alex Pabon: you will go to prison for 2 years and 9 months.  -ENDS-  9",

          "context": "R v William Cornick   Leeds Crown Court  3 November 2014    Sentencing Remarks       Mr Cornick, you may remain seated.    Introduction These  sentencing  remarks  will  be  divided  into  seven  sections.    The  first  three  sections  are  general.    They  will concern  the  victim,  Mrs  Ann  Maguire;  the  defendant, William  Cornick;  and  the  details  of  the  murder.    The remaining  four  sections  will  be  addressed  directly  to  the defendant  although  he  need  only  stand  for  the  last  one.   They  concern  the  mechanics  of  the  sentence  that  I  am  to impose;  the  aggravating  factors;  the  mitigating  factors;  and my conclusion as to the appropriate sentence.    1. Mrs Ann Maguire Sometimes it  can  seem inappropriate for  a judge’s sentencing remarks in a murder case to focus on the victim.  There  can  be  an  uncomfortable  tension  between  a  full explanation  of the  sentence  being imposed  on the defendant,  and  the  court’s  wish  to  describe  the  qualities  of the  person  who  has  been  murdered,  in  order  to  give  a proper sense of the loss that the killing has caused.   1 However,  no  such  difficulty  exists  here.  Ann  Maguire  was such  a  remarkable  person  that  it  is  only  right  that  I  start these  observations  by  focussing  on  her  personality  and  her achievements.  She  was  61  and  had  been  a  teacher  at Corpus  Christi  Catholic  College  in  Leeds  for  four  decades.   She was genuinely loved by her pupils.  The court has seen today  some  of  the  interviews  with  those  children  who  had  seen  her  murdered.    Notwithstanding  the  appalling  events  that  they  had  recently  witnessed,  many  of  them  wanted  to say something about how wonderful Ann Maguire was, both as a teacher and as a person.    Just by way of example, we heard one pupil describe her as “really  caring…she  sort  of  couldn’t  do  enough  for  people, she  was  just  really  lovely  to  everybody.”    Another  pupil described  her  as  “more  of  a  friend  than  a  teacher”.  And another,  when  asked  what  she  was  like,  said  “she  were wonderful.  She were just…she was so nice to everyone, she  were  kind,  she’d  always  stay  back  late…her  main  goal  for everyone in that class, she just wanted them to come on top and  achieve  what  she  knew  they  could  achieve  and  you  could  tell  she  loved  it.    You  could  tell  that  she  loved  doing what she were doing every day.” Similar  views  were  expressed  by  her  teaching  colleagues.  Susan  Francis,  the  Head  of  Languages  at  the  school,  who  bravely  intervened  during  the  attack  on  Ann  Maguire, described her as both “wonderful” and “fantastic”.  Another    2 teacher  at  the  school,  who  in  other  circumstances  might have  been  an  additional  victim  of  the  defendant,  described   Ann  Maguire  as  “an  amazing  woman  and  teacher”. Numerous  people  have  spoken  about  how  much  she  loved her job and how much, in return, her pupils loved her. Her  family  have  given  moving  evidence  of  her  numerous qualities. Her brother in law Brian, described her as “a shining light.  She  trod  her  own  path  and  lit  up  our  lives  in  so  many  different ways.  She was a joy to be with.”  Another brother in law, Tom, described “her shining, fun, bright personality, which  drew  people  to  her  and  when  you  were  in  her company  you  always  felt  you  were  the  most  important person in her world.” Her sister Denise said that Ann was not just her big sister, but  was  “my  carer,  my  protector,  my  teacher,  my confidante, my role model, the person who inspired me most  and  in  the  last  20  years  she  became  my  best  friend  in  life. Ann  was  genuinely  one  of  life’s  beautiful,  selfless, extraordinary, kind people.  She radiated happiness, joy and  positivity.  Her  smile  lit  up  the  room  and  people  wanted  to be  around  her,  they  were  attracted  to  her  energy  and  zest for life.” And her daughter Emma said:      3 “She  was  a  wonderful  mother.    She  gave  us  so  much love.  I never felt alone in life…. She felt every up and down  with  me  and  perhaps  more  acutely.    She  was stronger  than  all  of  us  put  together  and  carried  us through  many  of  life’s  many  challenges.   She  was  an extraordinary person.” Given all of this, it is perhaps unsurprising that Leeds Town Hall  was  full  to  overflowing  for  Mrs  Maguire’s  memorial  service on 29 September 2014. For those of us who never met Mrs Maguire or never had the good fortune to be taught by her, the devastation felt at her death is difficult to imagine.  But some sense at least of the pain and loss felt by her family can be found in their Victim Impact  Statements.  It  is  impossible  to  do  them  full  justice in  these  sentencing  remarks.  But  I  incorporate  into  them the following passages: Her sister Denise said: “I  am  overcome  with  an  overwhelming  sense  of  loss and injustice.  The fact [was] that Ann was at her place  of  work  doing  her  job  in  order  to  improve  the  lives  of children,  stretching  them  to  achieve  the  best  results they  could  in  their  up  and  coming  exams,  and  she didn't  come  home,  and  never  will  again.    I’m  haunted with thoughts that her life was taken in a place where  she felt her safest, most comfortable, respected and in command.    I’m  angry  that  she  was  denied  the opportunity to enjoy the retirement she had worked so  hard  for  and  was  so  deserved  of  after  41  years  of dedicated  service  as  a  public  servant.    I’m  angry  that she  will  never  meet  her  future  grandchildren  and  be able  to  nurture  and  guide  them  the  way  she  did  with     4 all the other children that were an integral part of her life.” And her daughter, Emma, said: “There  are  many  milestones  she  will  miss  and  many that  we  will  have  to  get  through  missing  her.  We  will no longer look forward to occasions, our loss shadows such  things.  No  birthday,  Christmas,  Mother’s  day, weekend  home  will  ever  be  the  same:  everything  is tainted now.  I just want to be able to talk to her.  She won’t  see  me  get  married  or  hold  her  first  grandchild, this  part  of  her  life  was  all  still  to  come,  she  was  so looking forward to it.  She deserved to live.”  Finally, there are the words of Ann’s husband, Don. “As  a  young  girl  Ann  visited  the  sick  and  helped  the  elderly  in  her  local  community.    The  hundreds  or maybe  thousands  of  wonderful  tributes  paid  over  the  months are testament to the person Ann Maguire.  The guidance  for  preparing  a  victim  impact  statement advises to avoid turning the victim of the crime into a kind of saint.  Such advice does not apply in this case.   Ann was a beautiful vivacious, caring generous human being.  She  was  unique  among  peers  and  family.    We met  and  fell  in  love  in  the  spring  of  1972.    We  were  a very  quiet  private  couple  constantly  dreaming  of  a  rural  backwater  but  the  world  seemed  to  shatter  our hopes  at  regular  intervals.    Now  all  dreams  have  gone forever.  I am still a Dad but I cannot help my children understand; can’t help them come to terms; can’t help    Mummy  would  have  been  much lessen  the  pain.I better.  I  can  no  longer  be  a  Dad.    I  fail  every  day.     need Ann.  Parts of our lives have been brutally taken. The centre of our lives is missing.  Our very being has been  diminished.    Facing  the  world  is  very  difficult. Facing one’s self is very difficult.”      5 It  is  therefore  all  the  more  inexplicable  that  this  loved  and loving  woman  was  the  person  for  whom  William  Cornick conceived such an irrational and all-consuming hatred; the person that he planned to kill, and then killed – in a public  place – in front of children – in such a brutal and cowardly way on 28th April 2014.  2. William Cornick William  Cornick  was  born  on  26  June  1998,  so  he  was  in Year 11, and two months short of his 16th birthday when he  killed  Ann  Maguire.  He  was  the  son  of  responsible  and caring  parents  and  his  family  life  was  marked  by  love  and support.  He was successful at school and was in his GCSE year,  having  already  taken  and  passed  five  exams  a  year  early.  He  was  regarded  as  reserved,  but  amicable,   enthusiastic,  and  a  conscientious  member  of  the  pupil  group.  Although  he  was  diagnosed  with  diabetes  in  2010,  which  meant  that  he  would  be  unable  to  pursue  an intended  career  in  the  army,  it  does  not  appear  that  this diagnosis had any other significant effect on his personality.     However,  as  he  advanced  through  his  teenage  years,  it became apparent to some of his friends that his personality  was  disturbed.    He  began  to  experience  increasing  feelings of  anger,  mainly  directed  at  Ann  Maguire,  and  all  of  them completely  irrational.  He  spoke  to  a  number  of  his  friends about  killing  her  and  at  least  one  other  teacher  at  the school.  He told them he had taken to carrying a knife and,    6  after  the  murder,  the  police  discovered  many  images  of knives  on  his  mobile  phone.    He  said  later  that  the  killing had been always on his mind for three years, since Year 8.    By Christmas 2013 it was apparent to Mr Cornick’s mother that her son had a problem with Mrs Maguire, although she did not know that late on Christmas Eve, and into the early  hours of Christmas Day, he was exchanging messages with a friend on Facebook in which he spoke of “brutally killing” Mrs  Maguire  and  then  spending  the  rest  of  his  life  in  jail.  These  angry  feelings  led  to  a  confrontation  of  a  sort  with  Mrs Maguire in February 2014 when the defendant’s hatred of his teacher was apparent to all those present at a meeting  at  the  school.  He  was  placed  on  internal  exclusion  in consequence of his disrespect and rudeness.    On  25  February  2014,  shortly  after  this  meeting  and  just two months before the killing, he sent a message to a friend on Facebook that said of Ann Maguire:   “…the  one  absolute  fucking  bitch  that  deserves  more than  death  more  than  pain  torture  and  more  than anything that we can understand.”   After  the  killing,  William  Cornick  was  the  subject  of extensive  psychiatric  and  psychological  examination.    The results  of  those  examinations  make  chilling  reading.    In particular: (a)\t  Dr  Diggle  is  an  adolescent  clinical  psychologist.    He  concluded  that  William  Cornick  generally  experiences    7  strong feelings of anger but there was little sign of that  in  his  outward  presentation.  He  had  a  very  high disposition to  experience  anger  without  specific provocation  and  his  ability  to  manage  his  angry thoughts constructively was limited. (b)\t  Dr Lengua, a consultant child and adolescent forensic   psychiatrist,  described  William  Cornick’s  anger  as  “premeditated  and  predatory”  and  that  one  of  the dangerous  aspects  of  his  personality  was  that  his outward  appearance  did  not  disclose  his  anger.    He  concluded  that  the  defendant’s  actions  leading  up  to the  killing  of  Mrs  Maguire  were  “pre-planned,  goal directed, and in full knowledge that they were wrong.”    He concluded that William Cornick posed an extremely high risk of serious violence and could not exclude the possibility that the defendant would kill again.   (c)\t  Dr  Kent  was  the  prosecution’s  leading  psychiatric   expert.  He  concluded  that  William  Cornick  was  at  least  of  average  intelligence  and  found  no  evidence  of any  thought  disorder,  psychotic  or  other  major  psychiatric  illness.  Dr  Kent  said  that  the  defendant  had an adjustment disorder (something with which Dr  Lengua agreed) and that this affected the development  of his personality at a time when he should have been developing  and  maturing  into  an  independent  person. He noted “a gross lack of empathy for his victim and a degree  of  callousness  rarely  seen  in  clinical  practice.”   He  found  evidence  of  personality  disorder  with  some  8 marked  psychopathic  traits  with a preoccupation  with homicide.  He said he presented a risk of serious harm  to  the  public  and  that  the  risk  was  immediate  and  unpredictable,  and  could  cause  serious  and  lethal injury. There  can  be  no  doubt  that  the  defendant  is  highly dangerous.  His  complete  lack  of  remorse,  which  is  a  significant feature of all of the psychiatric and psychological  evidence,  is  a  matter  to  which  I  will  return  later  in  these remarks.    For  completeness,  I  should  say  that  I  have  read all  the  reports  dealing  with  the  defendant,  including  the useful PSR from the Leeds Youth Offending Service.  3. The Murder of Ann Maguire As I have already noted, the defendant had long planned to  kill Ann Maguire.  To Dr Kent, he said that on Thursday, 24  April, he had decided that he would kill her rather than kill himself.  He  said  he  knew  he  was  going  to  kill  her  and  on  the Sunday he decided that it was going to be with a knife,  rather  than  the  other  options  that  he  had  considered,  including a blunt object, a gun, and pushing her out of the window.    Despite  this  level  of  planning,  his  outward appearance  was  polite  and  happy  throughout  the  weekend of 26 and 27 April 2014. On the morning of Monday 28 April he went to school with two knives in his bag.  One was a large and heavy knife with     9 a  cutting  edge  measuring  21cm  in  length  and  up  to  4.5cm in width.  In addition to a smaller knife, he also had a bottle of  Jack  Daniels  with  which  he  was  going  to  celebrate  after the killing. During that morning, he told a number of his fellow pupils that  he  intended  to  kill  Ann  Maguire  and  whilst  many  did not  take  him  seriously,  others  did,  and  at  one  point  he  threatened  to  kill  anyone  who  revealed  his  plan.    It  was plain  that  he  was  excited  by  the  thought  of  what  he  was going  to  do.  He  told  at  least  one  other  pupil  that  he intended  to  kill  two  other  teachers  as  well,  including  a female  teacher  who  was  pregnant,  and  who  he  intended  to stab in the stomach so as to kill her unborn child. The  attack  took  place  in  the  first  lesson  after  the  morning break,  just  after  11:30am.    William  Cornick  attended  Mrs  Maguire’s  Spanish  lesson  in  classroom  T51.    Some  of  the class,  including  William  Cornick,  then  went  to  classroom T50  so  they  could  work  more  productively.    There,  William Cornick  showed  a  fellow  pupil  the  larger  of  the  two  knives and  experimented  with  where  to  conceal  it.    He  then  left that  classroom,  winking  at  his  classmate  as  he  left,  and went back to T51.     Mrs  Maguire  was  at  her  desk  at  the  front  of  the  class, helping  a  pupil.  She  was  leaning  away  from  William Cornick  when  he  entered  the  room.  William  Cornick     10  approached Mrs Maguire from behind and began to stab her in the neck and back from behind.  She was 5’2” and of slim build;  the  defendant  was  a  foot  taller  than  her  and  armed  with  the  large  kitchen  knife  to  which  I  have  previously referred.  The  attack  was  relentless,  brutal  and  cowardly.  Mrs Maguire fled but Cornick pursued her, stabbing her as she sought to escape him.    Susan  Francis  came  out  of  an  adjacent  workroom  to  be confronted by a group of pupils running down the corridor, screaming in panic.  She saw Ann Maguire running towards her,  holding  the  back  of  her  neck  and  saying  “he  stabbed me  in  the  neck”.    Susan  Francis  pushed  Mrs  Maguire  into the workroom, and shut the door, courageously holding her foot  against  it  to  stop  the  defendant  coming  in.    Cornick then turned and walked away.  He  went  back  to  the  classroom  he  had  left  and  sat  down next to his classmate as if nothing had happened.  He said he  had  stabbed  Mrs  Maguire,  and  added  that  it  was  a  pity she was not dead.  He said out loud to the entire class “good times”,  and  spoke  of  an  adrenalin  rush.    The  evidence   makes  clear  that  he  was  pleased  with  what  he  had  done.  He  was  subsequently  taken  by  two  teachers  to  the  school  foyer and they waited for the police to arrive.  Cornick talked to  everyone  as  if  nothing  had  happened  and  many  of  those  involved were to speak later of his bizarre calmness and air of normality.    11      Ann Maguire was still alive in the workroom. Susan Francis comforted her but was only too aware that she was probably  dying,  so  she  spoke  to  her  about  her  children  and  the  fact  that  she  was  loved.  An  ambulance  was  called  but  on  the way  to  the  hospital  Mrs  Maguire  stopped  breathing  and never thereafter  regained  consciousness.  She  was pronounced  dead  at  Leeds  General  Infirmary  at  1:10in  the afternoon. The  subsequent  post  mortem  identified  that  she  had  been stabbed seven times to the upper back and neck.  One stab caused the knife to pass all the way through the lower neck and  another  severed  the  jugular  vein.    Two  other  stabs shattered  ribs  and  one  of  those  penetrated  her  right  lung.  All  of  the  wounds  were  inflicted  from  behind  and  the pathologist  concluded  that  many  were  inflicted  with  severe force.  The  experienced  paramedic  who  attended  to  Mrs Maguire  described  the  stab  wounds  as  the  worst  she  had ever seen.  4. The Mechanics of the Sentence  William  Cornick,  you  may  remain  seated  but  the  following remarks are addressed directly to you. The  sentence  for  murder  is  automatic:  given  your  age,  it  is  detention  during  Her  Majesty’s  pleasure.    That  is  an 12 indeterminate sentence; it is, to all intents and purposes, a life sentence. The  only  remaining  matter  for  me  is  to  fix  the  minimum term that you will serve.  I should make quite clear that this  means what it says: it is the minimum period that you will  serve  in  detention  before  you  are  even  considered  for release.  This minimum term cannot be reduced or changed  or cut down in any way.  Moreover, after it has been served, there  is  no  guarantee  whatsoever  that  you  will  then  be  released. You will only be released thereafter once the Parole Board  decides  that  you  no  longer  pose  a  danger  to  the public.  Given the psychiatric and psychological reports that I  have  read,  it  is  quite  possible  that  that  day  will  never come.  Pursuant  to  paragraph  7  of  Schedule  21  of  the  Criminal Justice  Act  2003,  Parliament  has  decided  that  the  starting point for the minimum term for anyone under 18 convicted  of murder, is 12 years.  Having adopted that as my starting  point,  as  I  am  obliged  to  do,  I  then  turn  to  the  aggravating and mitigating factors.  5. Aggravating Factors. In my view, there are seven significant aggravating factors. First,  there  is  your  extensive  premeditation  and  planning.  You  decided  to  kill  Ann  Maguire  months  before  you  did  so      13 and you openly fantasised about it.  The plan to kill her was formulated  long  before  the  act  itself,  and  included  a consideration  of  possible  weapons  and  methods.  You eventually  decided  some  days  before  the  event  that  you  would  stab  her  to  death  at  your  school.    You  took  two knives  with  you,  just  in  case.  In  every  respect,  this  was  a long way from a killing on the spur of the moment.   Secondly, you took a knife to the classroom with the express purpose  of  killing  Mrs  Maguire.  If  you  were  over  18,  that would give rise to a starting point for the minimum term of 25  years. I  do  not  agree  with  the  submission  that  a consideration  of  this  starting  point  is  wholly  irrelevant  to your sentencing exercise. Whilst, as I have said, it is not the  applicable starting point in your case, its substantial length demonstrates  Parliament’s  intention  to  punish  severely those,  like  you,  who  take  easily-available  household  knives to  the  scene  of  the  crime  in  order  to  carry  out  a  planned killing.  Thirdly, Mrs Maguire plainly suffered before she died: death was not instantaneous and the severity of the stab wounds demonstrates  the  pain  that  she  would  have  suffered  before  she  died.    Moreover,  it  is  plain  that  both  she  and  Susan Francis knew she was dying as she lay in the workroom.   Fourthly,  Mrs  Maguire  was  a  teacher,  teaching  a  GCSE Spanish  class  at  a  well-known  and  well-respected  Leeds     14 school.  She was therefore fulfilling a public duty.  Teachers play  a  critical  role  in  our  society  and  are  in  an  important position of authority.  They are entitled to proper protection, and  to  expect  that  those  who  injure  or  kill  their  colleagues are dealt with severely by the courts.  Fifthly,  this  was  a  killing  which  you  deliberately  chose  to commit  in  public.  You  killed  Mrs  Maguire  in  front  of  a  classroom  of  horrified  15  and  16  year  olds.    The  damage done  to  them  is  incalculable.    Many  may  be  traumatised  forever by what they saw. Your complete lack of empathy for them, your callous disregard for your classmates, is perhaps  the  worst  single  element  in  this  catalogue  of  aggravating factors.  Sixthly,  the  level  of  violence  was  savage  and  cowardly.  It was an attack on a petite woman in her 60’s by a strapping teenager  armed  with  a  large  knife.  It  was  carried  out  from behind.  It  was  a  sustained  attack  because  even  when  Mrs Maguire got away from you, you followed her and continued to stab her.   Finally, you have shown a total and chilling lack of remorse. Your lack of remorse was made plain to both Dr Diggle and Dr Lengua.  And to Dr Kent, you said: I “I  knew  what  I  was  going  to  do;  it  was  what  I  did.   said  I  was  going  to  do  other  stuff  but  I  never  got  the chance, other murders.  It was a triple homicide.  What I have done, I couldn’t give a shit…I wasn’t in shock, I     15 was happy.  I had a sense of pride.  I still do.  I know it’s  uncivilised  but  I  know  it’s  incredibly  instinctual and human.  Past generations of life, killing is a route It’s  kill  or  be  killed.    I  did  not  have  a of  survival. choice.  It was kill her or suicide.”  When  asked  by  Dr  Kent  about  the  impact  of  the  killing  of Mrs Maguire’s family and on the wider community, you said “I  couldn’t  give  a  shit…I  know  the  victim’s  family  will  be upset  but  I  don’t  care.  In  my  eyes,  everything  I’ve  done  is fine  and  dandy.”    At  one  stage,  you  described  Mrs  Maguire as “barely human”.   In my view, these remarks – your pride in what you did, and  your  complete  lack  of  remorse  –  are  truly  grotesque,  and  a  further significant aggravating factor which I must reflect in the sentence. In my view, these aggravating factors more than double the statutory  starting  point  of  12  years  and,  prior  to  any consideration  of  the  mitigating  factors,  would  lead  to  a minimum term of 25 years.  6. Mitigating Factors In my view, there are three mitigating factors. First,  there  is  your  guilty  plea.    As  a  matter  of  law,  the  maximum  credit  I  could  give  you  is  around  4  years  (one sixth of 25). However, whilst I agree that some credit is due   for  your  plea,  I  do  not  think  that  it  can  be  the  maximum.      16 There were numerous witnesses to the murder itself, so you  could  not  sensibly  have  denied  the  act  of  killing.  And  as  to the mental element of the offence, the agreed position is that your  adjustment  disorder  cannot  affect  your  criminal  culpability.  So  in  my  view  whilst  there  must  be  credit  for your  plea  –  which  on  any  view  was  early  –  should  be  no  more  than  2  years,  thereby  reducing  the  minimum  term  to 23 years.  Secondly,  there  is  the  adjustment  disorder  itself.  Although, as I have said, it is properly accepted that this has no effect on  your  criminal  culpability,  it  is  not  a  condition  for  which you or your family can be blamed. I accept therefore that it is  a  mitigating  factor  and  should  have  some  effect  on  the minimum term. Thirdly,  I  accept  that,  because  you  were  15  years  and  10 months  old  at  the  time  of  the  killing,  such  extreme  youth may not be fully accounted for in the 12 year starting point. That  applies  to  everyone  under  18,  and  so  could  therefore apply  to  somebody  two  years  older  than  you  were  at  the time of the killing.  In my view, these two further mitigating factors reduce the minimum term to one of 20 years.  I should add that, having made a reduction for your youth, I consider that it is inappropriate to make a further reduction  for  your  good  character,  which  is  principally  a  function  of your  youth.  And  whilst  I  have  considerable  sympathy  for     17 your parents, who cannot be held responsible in any way for what  you  did,  and  whose  statements  demonstrate  the devastation  you  have  visited  on  them  too,  it  would  be inappropriate  to  reduce  the  term  further  because  of  the  effect  a  lengthy  term  will  have  on  your  family.  That  was something  you  should  have  considered  before  you  decided to  kill  Mrs  Maguire.  Instead,  just  like  your  classmates,  you completely ignored  the  effect  of  your  crime  and its consequences  upon  them.  And  whilst  I  do  not  doubt  their ability  to  support  your  possible  reform  and  rehabilitation,  ultimately  that  can  only  come  from  you.  Thus  far,  I  am  bound  to  note  that  you  have  failed  to  show  any  signs  of  The  three  mitigating  factors  which  I  accept,  when  taken together,  reduce  the  25  years  to  a  minimum  term  of  20 7. Conclusion William Cornick, stand up.  For the murder of Ann Maguire, I sentence you to detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure.  The minimum term I impose is  one  of  20  years.    That  means  you  will  not  even  be  considered  for  release  until  the  year  2034.  As  I  have  said, whether or not you are in fact released then will be a matter for  others.  The  time  that  you  have  spent  on  remand  will 18 either. years.      count  towards  the  minimum  term.  The  Victim  surcharge applies.  You must now go with the dock officer.  19 ",

          "context": "    R v Kenneth Hall  Central Criminal Court  Sentencing Remarks of HHJ Pontius  26th June 2015  1.   This defendant pleaded guilty to Counts 1 & 3 on the indictment on 26 May last,       the first day of an intended trial of both the defendant and his wife, who faced all       three charges but whose plea to Count 1 (aiding and abetting her husband’s       Misconduct in a Public Office) was accepted by the prosecution. I sentenced her       straightaway but adjourned Mr. HALL’s sentencing in order that a Pre‐Sentence       Report could be prepared. 2.   Count 1 reflects a course of conduct pursued by this defendant over a period of       more than two years during which, as a Registered Psychiatric Nurse at       Broadmoor High Security Hospital, he repeatedly sold confidential information       about a number of patients, some of whom had committed extremely serious       crimes which had achieved nationwide notoriety over the last few decades.       The defendant was paid thousands of pounds by the News of the World and       Mirror Group Newspapers  ‐  £23,800 in total  ‐  both for that information and       for that supplied after his employment ended, using his wife’s bank account for        purpose. 3.   That grave breach of trust  ‐  the trust not only of the public in general, but of       course that of the patients themselves, many of them suffering from extremely       serious mental illness which had led to their detention in hospital for very many       years  ‐  would, on its own, have represented as appalling an offence of its kind       that could be imagined. This defendant’s criminal conduct, however, did not end       when his employment at Broadmoor finished in October 2004, because he       continued to pursue and to take advantage of his corrupt relationship with Mirror       Group Newspapers until July 2006.  During that period he was paid further sums       of money for the stories he supplied but, no longer working at Broadmoor and       thus having no access to patient records and other confidential information, he       provided his journalist contacts with fabricated material, the detail of which was       entirely false whilst purporting to relate to actual patients.       More seriously still, the police investigation revealed that he had also been       making up stories even whilst still employed as a nurse at Broadmoor  ‐  for no       other reason than that the more sensational the story, the more money he would        receive, at times ‐  presumably ‐ when there was a dearth of genuine material        to offer. In order to make those fabricated stories even more newsworthy and            thus more lucrative he also forged official hospital patient records in such          detail and with a degree of craft that display not only professional experience          but also an extremely fertile imagination. 4.  The defendant’s manufacture of so much false information, of course, totally undermines any suggestion that he was acting in, rather than against, the public interest. Thus there can be no viable attempt to justify what he did by claiming it was altruistic “whistle‐blowing” in order only to bring to public attention and urgent official scrutiny some suggested malpractice on the part of the hospital authorities or perceived favourable treatment of patients. 5.  This was, therefore, an abuse of public trust of such gravity as would rightly be utterly condemned by all right‐thinking members of the public as causing very serious harm to the public interest. 6.  I accept that the defendant was approached by a journalist, who provided him with contact details, at a social event and so did not seek out a potential purchaser of the confidential information to which he was privileged to have access by virtue of his work. Thereafter, however, it is plain  ‐  as reflected in the defendant’s basis of plea  ‐  that for many months he freely carried on what became a lucrative trade in information. 7.  There are no sentencing guidelines, as such, for the assistance of the court when considering cases of this kind. That is not surprising given the infinite variety of facts and circumstances which inevitably arise in such cases, perhaps the more so than in most other types of offending. The nearest similar cases are those concerning misconduct by prison officers who have sold information relating to criminals in their charge. Yet this case is more serious than those, in my view, because the individuals to whom the defendant owed a duty of care and in respect of whom, as he was well aware, he owed, in addition, a duty of confidentiality within the terms of the Code of Conduct, whilst many had committed some of the gravest crimes of violence to come before the courts of this country, nevertheless had done so whilst suffering from mental disorder to a greater or lesser extent and were therefore entitled not only to dedicated, professional care but to a high degree of respect for their privacy and for the unfortunate circumstances which had led to their indefinite detention. 8.  So far as mitigation is concerned I am able, in the context of these offences, entirely to disregard the relatively minor offences which occurred well into the defendant’s past. I also must bear very much in mind the plight of his wife, who  ‐  I am well aware, having seen her and heard mitigation on her behalf before sentencing her last month  ‐  is in poor health and heavily reliant on others for assistance in the sort of everyday tasks that a wife and mother would take pride in doing unaided. It follows, of course, that in addition this defendant bears by far the greater burden of looking after their three young children. A prison sentence, therefore, however short, will inevitably have a profound effect, both practical and financial, upon the whole family. That, of course, is a consequence which I should not hesitate to avoid if my public duty permitted as I have no wish to visit such additional difficulties on a family which already has very considerable problems, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.  Nevertheless, it is very often an unfortunate consequence of the sentencing process, when a defendant receives an appropriate sentence of imprisonment, that it is innocent dependants who suffer the effects far more harshly than the offender himself. That is a consequence, however, for which the offender alone must bear responsibility. Given Mrs. HALL’s state of health I very much hope that whatever state and local authority assistance may be necessary is provided to her and the children without delay. 9.  I also bear in mind the length of time which has elapsed between the commission of these offences and the defendant’s appearance before the court. Further, so far as his guilty plea is concerned, normally a plea entered for the first time on the first day of an intended contested trial would merit minimal credit. However, I accept that his wife’s position as a co‐defendant was uppermost in his mind in the weeks and months leading up to trial and in consequence I am able to give a little more credit than would otherwise be appropriate. Given the contents of the character references written to the court by people who know him well, I am also able to accept that the defendant’s plea, entered knowing that he faced the prison gates, reflects a degree of genuine remorse. 10.   KENNETH HALL, if you had pursued your pleas of not guilty to conviction by a jury I have no doubt, for the reasons I have set out, that the correct sentence would have been two and a half years’ imprisonment. In the light of all the facts of the case, and the powerful mitigating circumstances put forward on your behalf, I am able to reduce that sentence to one of two years upon both Count 1 and Count 3, those sentences to run concurrently. Of  that sentence you will be required to serve half before automatic release on licence, thereafter being liable to serve the outstanding balance if you commit any further offence during that time. Any days spent in custody since arrest will be deducted from the period you are required to serve. 11.  If the statutory victim charge applies in this case I make the necessary order in the appropriate amount. ‐ENDS‐ ",

They were the parents of Ndingeko Kunene, who was born on 1              January 2012.  He died on 14 June 2012. He was found to have been suffering                  from florid rickets resulting from severe vitamin D deficiency.          3.\t  Although at one point it was not entirely clear, it has become clear as a result of                   discussions that have taken place between the parties during the course of this              sentencing hearing that there are no material disputes of fact.  Those discussions              have led to further written bases of plea being filed by both Defendants today.                The  Crown  opened  the  hearing  on  the  basis  of  its  Case  Summary.  The  facts,                 events  and  dates  set  out  in  that  summary  are  not  disputed  on  behalf  of  the                Defendants, although they have drawn attention to certain other matters in their              1 bases of plea.  Reference should be made to all of those documents for greater                detail.  I hope it will suffice for present purposes if I summarise the facts.                    Factual summary   4.\t  From  birth  Ndingeko  had  medical  problems.  On  the  day  he  was  born  he  was                  moved for a day or two to the Special Care Baby Unit because of his low weight                  and  difficulty  in  establishing  breast  feeding.  However,  he  was  discharged  from            hospital on 6 January.  A care plan was put in place for visits by Social Services                  and  community  midwives. Before  he  was discharged,  the  Defendants said  that            they would bring him to hospital if he was unwell.  It is emphasised on behalf of                  the Defendants that Ndingeko’s vitamin D deficiency was not diagnosed at that             stage, nor was Mrs Kunene given advice about taking supplements, which would             have  been  important  in  particular  because  she  was  going  to  breastfeed            exclusively and in view of her ethnic origins and her vegan diet.             5.\t  Over the following weeks Ndingeko was visited by health visitors on a number of                occasions.  However, Mrs Kunene did not attend the scheduled 8 week check up               on 8 March and Ndigeko was not seen by a health care professional again before                14 June.   6.\t  From April 2012 it was appreciated by the Defendants that their son was unwell.                 However, his health fluctuated over the next two months.  Although he was not               visited by healthcare professionals as such, Mrs Kunene’s sister is a midwife and              did  visit  on  occasion.  On  9  April  she  noted  that  Ndingeko  had  apparently  lost                 weight and his breathing was wheezy.  She and another relative, who is a health                visitor, expressed concerns more than once and asked Mrs Kunene to consult her              2 GP.  She said that she would do so but would speak to her husband first.  It is                      clear that, because of their own religious beliefs, the Defendants did not in fact               seek  medical  assistance,  nor  did  they  seek  advice  for  example  from  the  NHS              Direct helpline.   7.\t  Both  Defendants  are  strict  Seventh  Day  Adventists.  However,  their  views  (in               particular Mr Kunene’s) appear to be very extreme and do not reflect the official               doctrine of that church.  On the other hand, it has been emphasised on behalf of                 the  Defendants  and,  in  particular  Mrs  Kunene,  that  they  have  not  refused  all              medical  interventions  at  all  times.  For  example,  a  vitamin  K  injection  was               accepted shortly after the birth although it had initially been refused.            8.\t  On 14 June 2012 Mr Kunene arrived home at around noon having done a night                 shift and was told that Ndingeko was not feeding properly. He noticed that his               son’s  health  had  deteriorated.  He  appreciated that  this  was  something  serious            and that his son might be close to death. He thought that he was suffering from                 low blood sugar and was dehydrated, so he prepared a solution of salt and water                for him. Ndingeko took this and straight afterwards breastfed.          9.\t  Mr Kunene went to bed at about 3:00 pm. Shortly afterwards Mrs Kunene took                their son upstairs to have a nap and laid him in bed next to his father. Mr Kunene                   waited until his son fell asleep before allowing himself to follow.            10. Later  Mr  Kunene  was  woken  by  his  wife,  who  said  Ndingeko  was  lifeless.  Mr                Kunene took his son downstairs and tried CPR to no avail.              3 The admitted offence of manslaughter      11. Importantly, Mr Kunene accepts, as he said in interview, that he realised when               he returned from work that day that Ndingeko might die and decided not to call                for  medical  assistance.  On  that  basis  he  accepts  that  he  is  guilty  of  gross               negligence manslaughter.   12. Mr Kunene accepts that he advised his wife that it would be a sin in the eyes of                    God  to  call  for  medical  assistance  as  he  had  made  a  vow  that  he  would  await                 guidance from God before doing so.        13. Mrs Kunene has, in a written basis of plea which is agreed by the Crown, pleaded                  guilty to the offence of gross negligence manslaughter only on the basis of the               omission to act to call for medical attention on 14 June itself. She accepts that                she realised that her baby was very unwell and at risk of death but did so only on                   that day. She adds that on that day itself she did wish to seek medical attention                 for the baby but Mr Kunene said that this would be a sin.               14. Mrs  Kunene  says  that  her  religious  convictions  were  a  significant  factor  in  her               deference  to  her  husband’s  view  that  medical  attention  should  not  be  sought             and her omission to call for medical attention.           Legislation and guidelines    15. The maximum penalty for manslaughter is life imprisonment.          16. By  virtue  of  section  143(1)  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003  this  court  must                consider an offender’s culpability as well as any harm which the offence caused.               17. There is no specific guideline issued by the Sentencing Council or its predecessor               for gross negligence manslaughter. However, general guidance is to be found in             4 the guideline issued by the former Sentencing Guidelines Council on ‘Overarching            principles: seriousness’.   18. It is not suggested on behalf of the Crown that an indeterminate sentence would                 be justified in this case. Nevertheless it is suggested that Schedule 21 to the 2003                Act  is  of  some  relevance.  This  is  because  it  provides  a  clear  indication  by               Parliament of its wish to see sentences for homicide increase by comparison to              the previous position. As Lord Judge CJ said in R v Wood [2010] 1 Cr App R (S) 2,                    at para 23: “this coincides with increased levels of sentence for offences resulting              in  death,  such  as  causing  death  by  dangerous  driving  and  causing  death  by              careless driving. Parliament’s intention seems clear: crimes which result in death            should be treated more seriously and dealt with more severely than before.”             19. In  R  v  Reeves  [2013]  2  Cr  App  R  (S)  21,  which  was  a  case  of  gross  negligence                    manslaughter,  at  para  13,  Treacy  LJ  said:  “it  is  now  beyond  argument  that  the               effect of the Criminal Justice Act has been to lift the level of sentencing in such                 cases… In short, the fact that a death has resulted from criminal conduct is to be                 given  rather  greater  recognition  than  hitherto.  Of  course  all  cases  are  fact             specific but the principle holds good. What might have been seen as a general               indicative figure of two to two and a half years after a trial for this kind of case in                    the past can no longer apply.”       20. The  court  explained  that  the  death  of  the  victim  was  by  definition  great  harm                and that on the facts of that case the Appellant’s culpability was high since she                had  totally  abandoned  her  responsibilities  as a  mother.  In  that  case  there  was              mitigation in the form of the Appellant’s previous good character and absence of              any other suggestion of ill treatment of her children. A sentence of 3 years and 9                  5 months after a guilty plea was upheld on the basis that the starting point after                trial would have been 5 years and a discount of 25% was appropriate given its                timing.  21. The  Crown  submit  (and  I  accept)  that  some  indirect  assistance  can  be  gained                from the guideline issued by the Sentencing Council on offences of child cruelty.              If  Ndingeko’s  life  had  been  saved,  the  Crown  submit  (and  I  accept)  that  the               Defendants’ conduct before 14 June 2012 would have fallen at least within the              third level of that guideline. For that level the guideline suggests a starting point               after trial of 36 weeks imprisonment and a range of 26 weeks to 2 years, where                 the offence involves more than one incident of neglect, not amounting to long‐            term behaviour, or a single incident of long‐term abandonment.  However, in the              present case, there was the additional significant fact that Ndingeko died and the              Defendants accept that they are guilty of manslaughter.           Aggravating and mitigating features     22. In my view, the aggravating features of this case are these:              (1) The victim, as a baby, was particularly vulnerable.          (2) The Defendants failed to heed warnings from relatives that they should seek              medical help from April 2012 onwards at a time when he was apparently unwell.               23. It is accepted on all sides that the following are mitigating features:               (1)  The good character of each Defendant.\t  Mr Kunene is now 36 years of age                  and Mrs Kunene is 32.  They are a dedicated and humble couple.              (2)  The  fact  that  the  Defendants  were  otherwise  apparently  good  and  caring             parents of their son.     6 (3)  The  complete  absence  of  any  evidence  to  suggest  that  Ndingeko  had  been              assaulted or ill treated by his parents.        (4)  Not only have the Defendants lost their first child, Mrs Kunene has since had                a miscarriage.   24. I  have  taken  into  account  Professor  Nussey’s  evidence  that  both  the  Darent               Valley  Hospital  and  Northumberland  Medical  Centre  played  a  part  in  failing            properly  to  advise  the  Defendants  and  to  prescribe  vitamin  D  supplements            (Ergocalciferol). The necessity and use of that supplement (which are suitable for             vegans and all the more important as Mrs Kunene is of African origin) was never                explained  to  either  of  the  Defendants.         I  have  also  taken  into  account  the        evidence  of  Dr  Allgrove  and  Dr  Barnard  in  this  context.  As  I  have  already                 mentioned, Ndingeko’s vitamin D deficiency was not diagnosed in the early days             after his birth and before he was discharged from the neo‐natal unit.               The Pre‐Sentence Reports    25. I have read the pre‐sentence reports in the case of each defendant.               26. The  report  in  respect  of  Mr  Kunene  realistically  accepts  that  an  immediate              custodial sentence is likely in this case.  On his behalf counsel has urged me to                 consider suspending any custodial sentence.      27. The  report  in  respect  of  Mrs  Kunene  also  accepts  that  immediate  custody  is  a                real possibility but suggests that consideration be given to whether the sentence             could  be  suspended.  This  has  been  urged  upon  the  court  by  counsel  on  her                 behalf at the hearing before me.       28. I am unable to accept those submissions in view of the seriousness of this case.                  7   Appropriate sentence   29. As I have already said, the sentence must fit the facts of each case.\t  I accept that                      this was not as serious a case as that in Reeves on its facts.  Nevertheless, the                   defendants  have  by  their  pleas  accepted  that  they  were  guilty  not  just  of              negligence  but  gross  negligence.  Furthermore,  they  accept  that  they  realised             there  was  a  risk  to  Ndigeko’s  life,  at  least  on  14  June  itself.  They  had  a                   particularly  high  degree  of  responsibility  for  his  health  and  welfare,  as  his             parents,  but they  decided  not  to call  for  medical  assistance  that day.  I accept                  that Mr Kunene’s culpability was higher than that of Mrs Kunene, who wanted to               call for medical assistance that day but deferred to his view.  Furthermore, the               background of the preceding two months is important.  Although the Defendants             did not appreciate the risk of death, they did realise that their son was unwell                but did not seek or obtain medical assistance.         30. The secular courts of this country apply the secular law of the land.  They do so                   equally to all who come before them.  The law respects the right of everyone to                 freedom of thought and belief.  However the right to manifest one’s religion is               not absolute.  It is limited in particular by the rights of others.  The state has a                   particularly important duty to protect the right to life, especially when a young              child is concerned.    31. In  my  view,  having  regard  to  all  the  circumstances  of  this  case,  including               aggravating and mitigating features, the appropriate sentence after trial would           have been 4 years for Mr Kunene; and 3 years for Mrs Kunene.  This is because of                   the difference in their degree of culpability, for reasons I have already set out.                8 32. I propose to give them about 25% credit for their guilty pleas.  I do not give full                      credit of one third in view of the time at which the pleas were entered, which                 was  a  few  weeks  before  the  trial  date  but  not  at  the  earliest  reasonable               opportunity.  This  is  in  fact  greater  than  would  normally  be  the  case  for  pleas                 entered relatively close to the trial date but this is because the Crown have urged                upon  me  that  a  more  generous  approach  is  justified  in  this  case,  since  the               Defendants’  pleas  in  substance  reflect  admissions  they  made  to  the  police  at             their  interviews  and  because  discussions  between  counsel  were  taking  place           about the possibility of pleas being entered before they were.           [The Defendants should now stand.]      33. Mr Kunene: the sentence of the court is imprisonment of 3 years.              34. Mrs Kunene: the sentence is imprisonment of 2 years and 3 months.                35. Unless released earlier, each of you will serve one half of your sentence and will                 then be released on licence until the end of your sentence.  While on licence you                 will be liable to recall by the Secretary of State.           [The Defendants can be taken down.]       Postscript  36. There  is  one  further  aspect  of  this  case  which  I  should  mention.\t  Ndingeko                 Kunene’s case was known to Social Services and health authorities from an early              9      stage in his life.  I have been informed that a Serious Case Review has already                   taken place and is due to report shortly.         37. It  is  to  be  hoped  that  all  necessary  enquiries  will  have  been  made  by  those                  authorities to establish that everything was done to protect Ndingeko’s life that             could reasonably have been done.      38. It would not be appropriate for me to comment further since I have not heard                   what others who are not parties to these proceedings and are not represented in               court may have to say about these matters.          10 ",

          "context": "  R V MUHAMMAD RODWAN  SENTENCING REMARKS OF THE HONOURABLE MRS JUSTICE CARR DBE   The victim surcharge order will apply as appropriate. Introduction Muhammad Rodwan, you are now 56 years old.  Having been acquitted of attempted murder and having an offensive weapon, you stand convicted by a unanimous jury of wounding PC Stuart Outten with intent contrary to s. 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.  This was a brutal and shocking attack with a machete on a police officer carrying out his duties during what should have been a routine stop of your van to investigate whether you were properly insured.  The facts At around midnight on 7 August 2019 you were lawfully apprehended by PC Outten and PC Helen Brooks for driving your van without insurance on Leyton High Road, E10.  Contrary to what you told the jury, I am sure that you knew when apprehended that you had no insurance:  your van was where you lived at the time, and your means of getting to your jobs as a handyman.  You kept work records and photographs of the back of your van show that you are an organised person. You would have been well alive to the important question of insurance. Moreover, when the police stopped you, both officers separately made it clear to you that they wanted to speak to you because they believed that you had no insurance at the time.  If you had genuinely believed otherwise, you would have simply said so. When you first pulled up, already angry, you refused to exit your vehicle. You drove off a short distance, then stopping again. You got out of your van and were immediately confrontational both in your body language and words, challenging the police officers in the street.  The officers on the other hand were polite and professional towards you, using the words “please” and “sir”. You ignored their lawful requests, instead returning to your van and attempting to get in and drive off again.   I am sure that the violence started with you - when PC Outten blocked your attempt to shut your door. You punched, or at least pushed, PC Outten out of the way. There followed a struggle between you and PC Outten in and around the driver’s seat. PC Outten arrested for you assaulting a police officer and cautioned you.  I accept that in the course of this struggle PC Outten used considerable force, pulling your hair so that several of your dreadlocks fell out.  PC Outten also put his left hand around your neck in order to subdue you. But I reject the unattractive submission that he was using 1 excessive force in circumstances in which you had assaulted him and were forcibly resisting arrest.   As he explained, he felt that he had no option but to proceed at the time as he did in prevention of further offending or escape on your part. You broke PC Outten’s grip from your neck and found a two foot long machete which you knew you had in your van.  Indeed you had only recently sharpened it. On the jury’s finding, you carried it to chop garden debris from your work as a handyman. I cannot accept that you chanced upon the machete, as you suggested to the jury; I am sure that you deliberately picked it up. You struck PC Outten’s head with it multiple times.  Once he realised what was happening, PC Outten shouted “machete”, not least to warn his colleague, and retreated, releasing and then pointing his yellow taser gun towards you.  I do not think for a moment that you thought it was a real gun, something you only suggested for the first time to your lawyers at the start of trial. You pursued PC Outten out of your van with the machete raised and swinging it at him with slashing motions.  I am sure, based on the witness evidence, that the machete connected with PC Outten’s body, most probably his right hand and arm.  With considerable presence of mind and fortitude, given his injuries, PC Outten fired the taser, first to no effect, but on the second occasion successfully.  You then fell to the ground. Had PC Outten not managed to disable you, you would have continued your attack. Whilst on the jury’s verdict you did not intend to kill him, I have no doubt that he feared for his life.  Several members of the public witnessed the incident, bravely recording it on their phones, and going to the assistance of the injured officer before other police officers arrived.  I am sure that this is not properly to be treated as a case of excessive self-defence.  The situation was entirely of your own making – all you had to do was cease resisting arrest, as you well knew, and then the struggle would have stopped. PC Outten told you in terms to “stop fighting, stop resisting”. But you were in a rage; the evidence from the witnesses and the recorded footage make that clear. You chose to cause unnecessary violence with the machete.  PC Outten sustained very serious injuries: six deep wounds in total to the head, all exposing the skull, and four outer table skull fractures, a superficial wound to the right forearm and a deep wound to the back of the right hand and multiple fractures of the fingers of the right hand.      PC Outten describes the impact of his injuries. In the months following the incident the right side of his forehead was paralysed.  He has permanent scarring. For some two months he could not make a fist with his right hand and for three months he could not drive. He still does not have full use of his middle right finger.  His hand still aches in the morning and he struggles to sleep.  He has not yet been allowed to return to work, with associated loss of income.  He is distressed at the pressure and upset caused to his family and those close to him, with the thought of the incident footage being played in open court.   PC Brooks has also been adversely affected. She is on medical leave as a result of her experience that night, and has not returned to front line police work since. She breaks down whenever she thinks about the incident and is currently on anxiety medication.  Sentencing Council Guideline and dangerousness I have considered the Sentencing Council Definitive Guideline for Assault. In the context of s. 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, I also need to consider dangerousness. Wounding with intent is a  2 serious specified violent offence. I must consider whether there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by you of further specified offences. This was unquestionably category 1 offending with a starting point of 12 years’ custody and a range of 9 to 16 years.  There was higher culpability with the dominant feature being the use of a weapon alongside the deliberate causing of more harm than was necessary for the commission of the offence (given the number of blows). I will treat the lack of premeditation, which in any event has to be seen in context, as a mitigating factor. There was greater harm with injury which is serious in the context of the offence and a sustained and repeated assault on the same victim. The presence of these multiple factors pointing to higher culpability and greater harm points to a term well above 12 years without more. But there is more, such that a term at the top of the range and even above it would be justified. I have in mind first the single most important and highly aggravating feature, namely that this was an offence committed against a police officer in the course of his duty. Further, it was committed in a public street in the presence of several members of the public. There is also an ongoing effect on PC Outten as indicated. You also have serious previous convictions.  In particular, you were convicted in 1982 for rape.  Given the age and different nature of this conviction, I do not propose to treat it as an aggravating factor.  However, you also have two convictions in 1997 for wounding with intent arising out of a single incident in 1996.  Whilst I take into account the age of these convictions and your lack of violent offending since, I cannot ignore them.  Notably, they involved the unprovoked use by you of a machete on two males.   By way of mitigation, all that can be said is this was not a planned attack.  I detect not a shred of remorse or insight on your part, but rather belligerent arrogance, typified by your comment when charged that your life was worth more than that of PC Outten. As for dangerousness, having considered carefully all of the relevant material before me, I have no doubt that you present a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission of further specified offences. I bear in mind your age, the period of non-offending, the lack of planning and the fact the jury found you not to be in unlawful possession of an offensive weapon. But the circumstances of this exceptionally dangerous and in particular sustained offending with a machete speak for themselves. Further, and whilst not the driving consideration, there is the background of your criminal and violent unprovoked use of a machete in the past.   Sentence There is no doubt that the custody threshold is passed.  Those who use knives to wound must expect severe punishment.  Recent authorities emphasise the need for an element of deterrence when sentencing in such cases. Attacks on police officers acting in the course of their duties are also rightly a matter of significant public concern. There must be a strong deterrent factor in your sentence.   Having found you to be dangerous, I need to consider whether the seriousness of your offending is such as to justify a life sentence.  Life sentences remain the sentence of last resort.  I consider that the public can be protected adequately by an extended sentence. I have considered a determinate sentence but do not consider that such a sentence would provide such protection. I therefore pass an extended sentence of imprisonment made up of two parts, a period of custody and an extended licence period. Bearing in mind all relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, the custodial term will be 16 years.  The licence period will be 3 years which is the further period of licence that I consider to be necessary to protect the public. 3  You will serve at least two thirds of the custodial term of years in custody. For the avoidance of doubt, time on remand will be taken into account. Your case will then be referred to the Parole Board who will decide whether you should be released and you will only be released if the Parole Board decides that it is safe to do so. Whenever you are released which will be no later than the date on which the 16 year term expires,  you will be on licence which will continue until the end of the licence period of 3 years making the total sentence one of 19 years’ imprisonment. Your licence will be subject to a number of conditions and if you break any one of those conditions your licence may be revoked and you will be liable to serve the rest of the total sentence in custody.  I order forfeiture and disposal of the machete. You may go down. 24 January 2020   4 ",

          "context": " R v Daniel Crompton In the Crown Court at Manchester 18 March 2014 Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Turner Daniel Crompton you have been found guilty of the murder of Frank Worsley: an innocent and defenceless 87 year old man. After an afternoon and evening of drinking and drug taking you ran out of money to fund further purchases of cocaine. You had already committed one despicable offence of burglary at the house of people known to you and whom you knew to be out. You used the proceeds from that burglary to buy cocaine.  After midnight, you decided that you would offend again. Having had the opportunity to hear the evidence, I am satisfied that you formed the specific intention to carry out a second burglary to make more money to buy yet more drugs. I find that you chose Mr Worsley’s house because the bathroom window was open. I reject your story that you were intending to break into you mother-in-law’s house, which you believed to  be  unoccupied,  and  did  not  realise  that  you  were  in  the  wrong  house  until  you  first encountered Mr Worsley. You neither knew nor cared if the house were occupied, so great was  your  craving  for  further  cocaine.  The  open  window  provided  the  opportunity.  Your craving for drugs provided the motive. The fact that you were already under the heavy influence of alcohol and cocaine dulled your senses to the likely consequences which, in this case, could hardly have turned out to have been more serious.          1 Your state of mind is amply evidenced by your reaction when Mr Worsley, still in his own bed and wakened by your intrusion into his bedroom in the middle of the night, told you to leave. You demanded to know where he kept his money. Moreover,  I  am  satisfied  from  the  evidence  that  you  proceeded  to  hit  him  in  the  face  on more than one occasion when he refused to tell you in an effort to beat the information out of him. You used your fist wrapped in your top. I am in no doubt that the use of the top was solely to protect your hand and not to mitigate the harm to Mr Worsley. This assault caused diffuse axonal brain damage and a sub-dural haematoma. The force of the  blows  was  at  a  level  to  be  expected  to  be  consistent  with  such  as  would  be  likely  to cause  concussion.    Regrettably,  the  treatment  for  the  haematoma  in  hospital  involved increasing  the  risk  of  the  formation  of  blood  clots  by  reversing  the  effects  of  the  blood thinning  drugs  which  Mr  Worsley  was  taking  for  his  heart  condition.  Clots  formed  and lodged in his brain causing two major strokes leading on to deterioration and death. You on the other hand, while Mr Worsley was on his way to hospital, were busily spending the money you had taken from him on yet more cocaine. But for your carelessness in leaving a handprint at Mr Worsley’s address, you might have got away with it. After  your  arrest,  you  showed  no  initial  remorse  and  did  not  co-operate  with  the  police choosing instead to offer no comment interviews. Your attack on Mr Worsley was as brutal as it was cowardly. The jury has found that when you attacked Mr Worsley you intended to cause really serious injury. This attack caused Mr Worley’s death and so you are guilty of murder. There is only one sentence for murder. It is life imprisonment. But the law requires me to fix the period which must pass before you are eligible for release on licence, or to decide that you should never be released.           2 The minimum term which I will impose should not be confused with a determinate sentence of the same length. Because a determinate prisoner is released at the half way point in his sentence, a life sentence with a minimum term is the equivalent of a determinate sentence of  double  that  length.  So  for  instance,  a  25  year  minimum  term  is  the  equivalent  of  a determinate sentence of 50 years.  And there are two further important differences. A determinate prisoner knows that he will be released at the half way point. Someone sentenced to life imprisonment, as you will be, will  have  no  guarantee  of  release  once  the  minimum  term  has  passed.  It  will  be  for  the Parole  Board  at  that  stage  to  say  if  it  will  be  safe  for  you  to  be  set  free.  And,  even  then, freedom will be relative. You will remain on licence for the rest of your life. If you commit another offence or otherwise breach your licence, you may be re‐detained. Under paragraph 5(1)  of schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 Act where the court considers that the seriousness of the offence is particularly high and the offender is over the age of 18 then the appropriate starting point is 30 years. Under Paragraph 5(2), cases which would  normally  fall  within  this  category  include  a murder  done  for  gain  such  as a  murder done in the course or furtherance of robbery or burglary. It is important to recognise that use of the word “normally” means that not every murder done  in  the  course  or  furtherance  of  robbery  or  burglary  automatically  attracts  a  starting point of 30 years. As the Lord Chief Justice observed in R v Cole [2008] EWCA Crim 1060: “We are concerned that at the sentencing hearing there appears to have been a somewhat mechanistic or arithmetical approach in this case, an approach perhaps encouraged by the terms  of  Schedule  21.  Schedule  21  is  intended  to  provide  general  guidance  to  the assessment  of  the  seriousness  of  an  offence.  The  factors  set  out  in  paragraph  5(2)  are factors  which  will  normally  lead  the  court  to  conclude  that  the  offence  was  one  of particularly  high  seriousness.  If  it  does,  then  the  section  lays  down  a  starting  point  for arriving at the minimum term of 30 years. But whether the court starts at 15 or 30 years, the sentencing exercise requires an assessment of the seriousness, having regard to the facts of       3 the particular case; and that can result, quite properly, in a sentence that is some distance from the starting point that has been taken.” Further,  the  case  of  Bouhaddaou  [2006]  EWCA  Crim  3190  emphasises  the  seriousness  of murders committed in the furtherance of burglary. In this case I am of the view that the element of gain in this case was not one which goes to the  heart  of  the  your  culpability  and  bearing  in  mind  the  lack  of  premeditation  and  the relatively low sums involved I am not satisfied that paragraph 5(1) is engaged. I take, therefore, the starting point to be that of 15 years but having done so must go on to weigh the aggravating and mitigating features. Particular aggravating features: 1.  The advanced age of your victim. 2.  The fact that the attack took place in his home at night. 3.  The fact that your selfish motive was gain. (Although the significance of this element does not serve to put the case in the 30 year category it still falls to be taken into account as a serious aggravating factor at the lower starting point). 4.  Your previous convictions. Particular mitigating features: 1.  Lack of premeditation. 2.  Lack of intent to kill. 3.  Your relative youth. 4.  The evidence of albeit late-flowering remorse when in custody awaiting trial.  The case of Cole, which I remind myself is not a guideline case and provides no more than a pointer,  also  involved  a  fatal  attack  perpetrated  by  a  drug  addict  upon  a  pensioner  living alone. The Court of Appeal raised the minimum term of 18 years imposed by the trial judge to one of 22 years. 4           The circumstances of that case were different to this in this case in a number of respects: 1. It involved a far more sustained and physically violent attack. There were 24 injuries to head and neck alone 2.  The perpetrator disconnected his victim’s telephone after the attack. 3.  The  murder  had  been  preceded  by  a  protracted  and  pitiless  fraud  perpetrated  by the defendant upon his victim in the period up to the attack. 4.  The defendant was older than you are.  Taking  a  starting  point  of  15  years,  I  find  that  the  aggravating  features  outweigh  the mitigating  features  in  your  case  to  the  extent  that  the  minimum  tern  should  be  adjusted upwards  to  one  of  18  years.  On  counts  two  and  three  the  sentence  is  one  of  eighteen months imprisonment on each allowing for credit of one third for the guilty pleas. These run concurrently to each other and to the sentence for murder.  You will be given credit for such time as you have already spent in custody and will pay the victim surcharge. You may take him down.      5 ",
