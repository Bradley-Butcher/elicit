  SENTENCING REMARKS OF HHJ CHRISTOPHER MOSS QC CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT   20 APRIL 2012   CHRISTOPHER OMOREGIE, OBI NWOKEH, SAMSON ODEGBUNE, FEMI  OSERINWALE, ADONIS AKRA, SAMUEL ROBERTS, ENOCH AMOAH AND TYRONE   RICHARDS First Group: OMOREGIE, NWOKEH and ODEGBUNE: On the 25th March 2010 at about 5.15 pm, during the evening rush hour, in the presence  and  sight  of  many  horrified  commuters,  Sofyen  Belamoudden,  a  fifteen  year  old  boy,  was  attacked  in  the  ticket  hall  of  the  District  and  Circle Line  at  Victoria  Station  by  a  pack  of  teenagers.  The  attack  lasted  some  12  seconds  and  was  captured  on  CCTV.  He  was  stabbed  with  knives,  battered with other weapons, kicked with shod feet. When those 12 seconds were over Sofyen  was  left  fatally  wounded  –  with  no  less  than  nine  stab  wounds  to  his body - as his attackers made their escape. Most of them ran to a bus stop in  Buckingham Palace Road where they boarded a C10 bus. When police boarded  the bus at the next bus stop they found, amongst other weapons and potential weapons,  two  particular  knives.  Both  had,  it  transpired,  been  used  to  stab Sofyen. One was in a bag that belonged to you, Christopher Omoregie and the other was wrapped in a newspaper that bore your fingerprints, Obi Nwokeh.  Upon  the  basis  of  the  evidence  provided  by  the  CCTV  and  those  murder weapons you were both convicted by the jury in your joint trial of Murder. You denied your guilt at trial and continue to deny it to this day, according to your      R  V1 pre-sentence  reports.  You  have  also  both  been  convicted  of  Conspiracy  to Cause Grievous Bodily Harm, the basis of which I will deal with in a moment. You Samson Odegbune, were tried by a second jury in a separate trial.  You, too,  were  convicted  of  the  murder  of  Sofyen,  although  you  took  no  physical part in that final attack upon him in the ticket hall.  You were also convicted of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm. The dreadful events at Victoria Station on that afternoon had their roots in a confrontation that had taken place the previous afternoon at the same station,  beginning in the food court on the 2nd floor where many young people used to  gather  on  their  way  home  from  their  schools  and  colleges.  You  were  all students  at  the  St  Charles  Sixth  Form  College  in  Ladbroke  Grove.  You  and many of your fellow students who were on their way to their homes in South London  used  to  travel  through  Victoria,  arriving  on  a  52  bus  and  going  on  either by bus or by rail.  The other protagonists on that previous day were, it  seems,  students  from  another  West  London  school  or  schools.  The  disagreement  that  took  place  ended  with  one  of  your  number  receiving  a  bloody nose at the hands of the opposition.  That  night  and  the  following  morning  there  was  communication  by  text  and by  face  book  messages  between  members  of  your  group  amongst  themselves and  with  members  of  the  opposing  group.  I  need  not  go  into  that  communication  in  any  detail  save  to  say  that  you,  Odegbune,  played  a principal  role  in  it.  You  and  the  others  involved  expected  trouble  and  you made  it  clear  that  you  intended  to  come  to  college  the  next  day  armed  with your  samurai  sword.  The  result  was  that  the  St  Charles  students  plainly expected  that  there  was  going  to  be  serious  violence  the  following  day, probably,  as  you  then  believed,  in  the  vicinity  of  your  college  in  Ladbroke Grove.  You  expected  the  West  London  Boys  –  as  you  referred  to  them  –  to come  to  the  college  in  force  for  a  violent  confrontation.  Many  of  your  fellow students  came  to  college  on  that  day  with  a  variety  of  weapons.  You,  Odegbune,  had  a  samurai  sword.  You,  Omoregie,  brought  to  college  2  chef’s steels.     2       The expected violence was, it appears from the evidence in the case, the talk of the  college  on  that  Thursday  morning  and  afternoon.  As  it  happened,  no opposing  group  came  to  the  college,  and  consequently  you  all  expected  the  confrontation  to  take  place  at  Victoria  Station  as  you  made  your  way  home  after college. You all travelled to Victoria expecting and intending trouble and prepared for it.  You,  Odegbune,  had  your  sword.  You,  Omoregie  and  you,  Nwokeh,  were  each  by  now  armed,  as  I  am  satisfied  you  were,  with  the  knives  later  to  be found on the C10 bus and already referred to.  It was in this way that the conspiracy, the subject of count 1, came into being. You all arrived at Victoria and gathered on the corner of Buckingham Palace Road  by  the  Grosvenor  Hotel.  It  was  not  long  before  the  opposing  group  arrived,  also  by  bus,  from  West  London.  They  made  their  presence  known,  challenging your group from the other side of Terminus Place where the buses arrive and depart.  You,  Odegbune,  led  the  charge  that  resulted.  You  had  taken  out  your  sword.  You shouted “we’re going to fuck you up”.   Although, as I have acknowledged, you  were  not  part  of  the  group  that  attacked  and  killed  Sofyen,  you  were convicted of murder on the basis that you intended that, in the course of your  attack  on  the  opposing  group,  someone  should  be  killed  or  caused  really serious bodily harm or you realised that such might be the consequence and nevertheless took part in the violence. The punishment for the offence of murder is fixed by law. You were all aged under the age of 18 at the date of the offence. You, Omoregie and Odegbune were  both  16  years  old  and  you,  Nwokeh,  were  17.  Consequently  you  fall  to have passed upon you for the offence of murder sentences of Detention at her Majesty’s  Pleasure,  and  those  are  the  sentences  that  I  pass  in  each  of  your cases. But I have to determine the minimum term that each of you must serve  before you may be considered for release on licence by the Parole Board. It is  3 agreed that, because of your ages at the date of the offence, the starting point  for  each  of  you  is  a  minimum  term  of  12  years.  That,  however,  is  just  the  starting  point  and  there  are  a  number  of  factors  to  be  taken  into  account before I arrive at the minimum term to be served in each of your cases.  You all have the mitigation of youth, although that factor is largely subsumed  in the starting point. Nevertheless I bear the fact of your youth in mind in your favour.  So  far  as  an  intention  to  kill  is  concerned,  nobody  who  has  seen  the CCTV  of  the  killing  could  possibly  conclude,  bearing  in  mind  the  number  of  weapons  at  the  scene  and  the  use  to  which  they  were  put  in  a  ferocious  and merciless attack upon the deceased, that there was any less than an intention  to kill him.  There are a number of factors which in my judgment aggravate the offence for which you have been convicted.  (1)  There was a considerable degree of planning and premeditation;  (2)  You  gathered  together  for  the  purpose  of  serious  mass  violence  in  a   busy  public  place  at  the  height  of  the  rush  hour  when  you  must  have  anticipated  many  innocent  members  of  the  public  would  be  going (3)  You acted in a large group and the deceased was attacked by at least 8  about their lawful business; persons; (4)  You carried and used weapons as described above;  (5)  None  of  you  has  shown  any  kind  of  remorse  nor  do  you  in  any  way  acknowledge responsibility for your crime. Had you been 18 years or older at the time of the commission of the offence,  you would have been liable for a starting point for your minimum term of 25 years, due to the carrying of knives and other weapons. In fixing the minimum term I take into account your convictions on count 1 of the indictment for conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm.       4 I see no reason to deal with any of you differently to the others. You, Omoregie and Nwokeh, were principals in the attack upon the deceased. You, Odegbune,  as I have already said, were a principal organiser of the dreadful events of that day. In each of your cases I take into account all that has been advanced on your behalves, and the positive aspects of your conduct while in custody. In each of your cases I set the minimum term for your sentences of detention at her Majesty’s pleasure at 18 years. So far as count 1 of the indictment is concerned, in view of the contents of your pre-sentence  reports,  I  do  not  invoke  the  dangerousness  provisions  which  would  lead  to  an  indeterminate  sentence.  You  will  each  serve  concurrent sentences of 8 years detention in a young offender institution. You,  Omoregie,  will  received  credit  of  753  days  towards  your  sentence,  you, Nwokeh, 753 days, and you, Odegbune, 700 days. I make no orders for recovery of defence costs in any of your cases. You may all go with the dock officers. Second Group: ODERINWALE, ROBERTS and AKRA On the 25th March 2010 at about 5.15 pm, during the evening rush hour, in the presence  and  sight  of  many  horrified  commuters,  Sofyen  Belamoudden,  a  fifteen  year  old  boy,  was  attacked  in  the  ticket  hall  of  the  District  and  Circle Line  at  Victoria  Station  by  a  pack  of  teenagers.  The  attack  lasted  some  12  seconds  and  was  captured  on  CCTV.  He  was  stabbed  with  knives,  battered with other weapons, kicked with shod feet. When those 12 seconds were over Sofyen  was  left  fatally  wounded  –  with  no  less  than  nine  stab  wounds  to  his  body - as his attackers made their escape. Most of them ran to a bus stop in          5 Buckingham Palace Road where they boarded a C10 bus. When police boarded  the bus a number of weapons used in the attack were discovered and seized. You have all been convicted of the manslaughter of the deceased. Additionally, you  all  stand  convicted  on  count  1  of  the  indictment  of  conspiracy  to  cause  grievous bodily harm. You, Roberts, and you, Akra, were present at the attack upon  Sofyen  in  the  ticket  hall  and  took  part  in  it.  You,  Roberts,  kicked  the   deceased 3 times as he lay helpless upon the floor. No one who has seen the  CCTV  images  of  the  scene  could  fail  to  be  horrified  by  the  ferocity  of  one  of kicks you delivered to the head of the deceased. It was as if you were kicking a rugby  football.  Your  actions  were  vicious  and  your  victim  defenceless.  You,  Akra,  as  you  admit,  struck  the  deceased  upon  the  neck  with  a  chef’s  steel  which it seems you had obtained from one of your co-defendants, Christopher  Omoregie.  True  it  is,  as  has  been  urged  on  your  behalf,  that  you  spent  only part  of  the  short  but  dreadful  attack  in  the  ticket  hall  and  that  you  were  the  first  to  leave  the  scene.  But  you  stand  convicted,  as  do  you  Roberts,  on  the  basis that you knew that at least one of  your group was armed with a knife or  other bladed weapon and that you foresaw that such weapon might be used to cause some harm, albeit less than grievous bodily harm.  You, Oderinwale, acted as armourer and that is the basis upon which you were convicted  of  manslaughter.  You  were  not  present  at  the  scene  of  the  attack; you  had  run  on  with  others  across  Terminus  Place  as  I  shall  presently describe.  Nevertheless,  you  were  responsible  for  the  purchase  of  a  block  of  kitchen knives from Argos in Shepherds Bush in the early afternoon of the day of  these  events;  some  of  those  knives  were  used  to  kill  Sofyen;  you  were  convicted  on  the  basis  that  you  intentionally  purchased  or  assisted  in  the purchase,  or  distributed  or  assisted  in  the  distribution  of  those  knives realising  that  some  harm,  albeit  short  of  grievous  bodily  harm,  might  be caused to another by the use of those knives or any of them. The  dreadful  events  of  that  day  had  their  roots  in  an  altercation  on  the previous  day  at  Victoria  Station  in  the  course  of  which  one  of  your  fellow students,  Melvin  Mensah,  received  a  bloody  nose.  That  night  there  was     6 considerable  text  and  facebook  communication  between  some  students  at  your  college  and  also  with  members  of  what  I  will  call  the  opposing  group,  referred  to  as  the  West  London  boys.  You,  Oderinwale,  were  amongst  those who took a principal part in those communications. You made reference to the fight that had taken place; you spoke of a “madness” that was planned to take  place the following day between students from St Charles College and others; you  sought  a  “flick  out  ting”;  you  asked  for  someone  to  help  you  buy  some “nank”  (knives)  from  Argos,  giving  the  link  to  the  Argos  website.  When  you were  asked  by  another  if  the  “beef”  was  “proper  serious”  you  replied  “if  they see anyone they’re gonna get slumped” – in other words killed. You said that everyone  should  be  “tooled  up”.  In  that  way  you  helped  to  initiate  the conspiracy that was charged in count 1.  Neither you, Akra, nor you, Roberts, can be said to have played any part in the conversations of that night. Nevertheless, it is clear from the evidence in the  trial that the expected violent confrontation was the talk of the college on the following day and I have no doubt that you both travelled to Victoria on that  afternoon expecting the sort of violent confrontation which in fact took place and prepared to play your part in it. Such  a  violent  confrontation  in  fact  took  place.  Your  group  gathered  in Terminus Place outside the Grosvenor Hotel. When challenged by members of  the  opposing  group  you  all  joined  the  mass  charge  across  the  bus  lanes  of Terminus  Place.  You,  Oderinwale,  as  I  have  already  indicated,  ran  on, pursuing members of the opposing group. You, Akra and Roberts, joined the group  of  killers  who  set  upon  Sofyen  Belamoudden  as  he  lay  helpless  and defenceless  upon  the  floor  of  the  ticket  hall,  in  the  sight  of  those  many  horrified  onlookers  who  had  been  going  about  their  lawful  business  at  the height, as I have said, of the rush hour.  I  take  into  account  in  all  of  your  cases  that  which  I  have  read  about  you  in your pre-sentence reports and in the testimonials provided on your behalves. I take into account the way you have conducted yourselves whilst in custody. I  take  into  account  in  each  of  your  cases  your  youth  at  the  time  of  the     7 commission  of  these  offences.  You,  Oderinwale  and  you,  Akra,  were  16,  you Roberts were 17. In  view  of  what  I  have  heard  and  read,  I  do  not  feel  the  need  to  invoke  the dangerousness  provisions  which  would  lead  to  an  indeterminate  sentence  in any  of  your  cases.  I  will  pass  in  each  of  your  cases  determinate  sentences  of detention  in  a  Young  Offender  Institution.  You,  Oderinwale,  will  have  credit  for  700  days  in  custody;  you,  Akra,  for  753  days  and  you,  Roberts,  for  753  days. You will each serve half of your sentences before you may be considered for release upon licence. The killing of Sofyen Belamoudden took place in dreadful circumstances in a public place as I have already described. You all played your parts in his death as set out above and stand convicted of his manslaughter. His death occurred following a conspiracy to which you were all parties. You, Oderinwale, were an early member of the conspiracy. You, Akra and you, Roberts, probably joined it later. On count 2 of this indictment there is no need to distinguish between you. You  will  each  serve  12  years  in  a  young  offender  institution.  On  count  1  you, Oderinwale will serve 8 years in a young offender institution concurrent with your sentence on count 2 and you, Akra and you, Roberts, will serve 7 years in  a young offender institution concurrent with your sentences on count 2. I make no orders for recovery of defence costs in any of your cases. You may go with the dock officers. Group 3: Enoch AMOAH and Tyrone RICHARDS You  have  each  been  convicted  of  count  1  on  this  indictment,  conspiracy  to cause grievous bodily harm, and on count 3, violent disorder. You were both acquitted  of  any  criminal  complicity  in  the  death  of  Sofyen  Belamoudden.  I          8 say  that  immediately  so  that  it  may  be  plainly  understood  that  I  put  that dreadful killing out of my mind in sentencing you for your offences. The  conspiracy  to  cause  grievous  bodily  harm  arose  from  events  on  the  24th  March  2010  at  Victoria  Station  when,  in  a  confrontation  between  students from  St  Charles  College,  where  you,  Amoah,  attended  but  you,  Richards,  did not,  and  other  youths,  known  collectively  as  the  West  London  boys,  a  St Charles student, Melvin Mensah, suffered a bloody nose. During the evening that followed, the conspiracy charged in count 1 came into existence. Trouble  of a violent kind was expected the following day, at first outside the college in Ladbroke  Grove  but,  when  that  did  not  materialise,  at  Victoria  Station. Neither  of  you  appear  to  have  become  involved  in  the  conspiracy  until  the following day, the 25th March 2010. You, Amoah, travelled to Victoria on the 52 bus from Ladbroke Grove with many of your fellow students, a number of  whom were armed with knives or other weapons. It is not suggested that you  yourself were armed. However, once at Victoria Station, you plainly joined the  agreement hatched by others to cause grievous bodily harm to anyone of the opposing group who might be present there. You joined the charge across the bus  lanes  of  Terminus  Place.  You  were  parties,  as  your  convictions demonstrate,  to  at  least  the  threat  of  unlawful  violence.  A  large  number  of innocent  members  of  the  public  were  lawfully  going  about  their  business during  the  height  of  the  rush  hour.  Not  only  evidence  heard  at  trial  but  also CCTV  images  demonstrate  the  fear  in  which  you  and  your  co-defendants placed those people. You,  Amoah,  joined  your  college  contemporaries  in  the  unlawful  agreement charged  in  count  1.  You,  Richards,  came  to  be  there  because  of  your  close family  relationship  with  Samson  Odegbune  who  was  not  only  a  party  to  the conspiracy, but an instigator of it, as well as being responsible for the murder of a fifteen year old boy which took place during the violent disorder. I have no  doubt  that  you  attended  the  scene  –  joining  the  52  bus  in  which  Odegbune was a passenger in Kensington as it made its way to Victoria – at the behest of your close relative. You were seen to join the eventual charge across Terminus Place with something in your hand. The prosecution claimed it was a knife or     9 other  bladed  article.  You  deny  that  it  was.  I  am  unable  safely  to  determine what you were carrying. But take part in the charge you undoubtedly did. In  each  of  your  cases  I  take  into  account  the  contents  of  your  pre-sentence reports.  I  find  no  need  in  either  of  your  cases  to  invoke  the  dangerousness   provisions which would result in indeterminate sentences. I take into account in each of your cases your youth – you, Amoah were 17 at the time, you are 18 now. You, Richards, were but 15 years old at the time, and are still under the age of 18. Your offence of conspiracy, Richards, I say at once, is too serious to  justify the imposition of a detention and training order and so you will fall to be sentenced to a period of detention under section 91 of the Act of 2000.   So far as you are concerned, Amoah, on count 1 of this indictment I impose a period of detention in a Young Offender Institution of 7 years with a period of 3  years  concurrent  in  respect  of  count  3.  You  will  have  credit  for  566  days spent in custody. You will serve half of that sentence and may then be released on licence for the remainder. So far as you are concerned, Richards, I sentence you to a period of detention under  section  91  on  count  1  of  this  indictment  for  7  years,  of  which  you  will also serve half before release on licence, with 700 days credited for time spent  in  custody.  In  view  of  my  limited  powers  because  of  your  age,  I  pass  no  separate penalty on count 3, Violent Disorder. The sentence imposed on count 1 is commensurate with the seriousness of both your offences. I make no order for defence costs in either of your cases. You may go with the dock officers.          10
