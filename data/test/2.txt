  THE HON MR JUSTICE HOLROYDE  A PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE NORTHERN CIRCUIT     THE QUEEN -V-  CHRISTOPHER JAMES MCGEE  T2012 7172    CROWN COURT AT LIVERPOOL   SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE HOLROYDE  15TH NOVEMBER 2012     You have been convicted by the jury of the manslaughter of Georgia Varley.  Her life  was ended in a dreadful way at the age of just 16 by your gross negligence. You did not intend to kill or even to injure her, but you displayed an appalling disregard for her safety, and she paid for your criminal negligence with her life.   When  a  crime  of  homicide  is  committed,  one  life  is  ended  but  many  more  lives  are damaged  or  destroyed.  In  an  eloquent  written  statement,  Georgia  Varley’s  mother  has made very clear the excruciatingly painful sadness which she suffers.  Of course, she is not alone in grieving: Georgia’s father, her wider family and her friends have all suffered  and  will  continue  to  suffer.  No  sentence  of  the  court  can  bring  back  their loved one, or make up for their loss. In assessing the seriousness of your offence, and deciding the appropriate sentence, I am required by s143 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to consider your culpability in committing  the  offence  and  the  harm  which  you  caused.    Since  that  Act  came  into force, the courts have placed a greater emphasis than before on the fatal consequence of a crime.  That greater emphasis was made clear in the case of Appleby [2010] 2 Cr  App R (S) 46, and in the recent case of Holtom [2011] 1 Cr App R (S) 18 the Court of Appeal has confirmed that the same approach is to be adopted in cases such as this where manslaughter is committed by gross negligence.  It is important that everyone         understands that this is not a case of murder, and that the level of sentence which is  appropriate  to  murder  is  not  appropriate  to  manslaughter.    That  is  because  murder involves  an  intention  to  kill  or  to  cause  really  serious  injury,  whereas  manslaughter  does  not.  Nor  is  this  a  case  in  which  you  are  likely  to  be  a  danger  to  others  in  the  future,  and  so  an  extended  or  indeterminate  sentence  is  not  needed  to  protect  the public.  Nevertheless,  as  Mr  Birkett  has  realistically  acknowledged  on  your  behalf, your  crime  is  plainly  so  serious  that  nothing  less  than  a  sentence  of  immediate imprisonment would be appropriate. As  to  the  length  of  that  sentence,  there  is  no  definitive  sentencing  guideline  which directly applies to this offence. You  do  not  have  the  mitigation  of  a  guilty  plea.    However,  Mr  Birkett  has  rightly  identified  a  number  of  features  of  the  case  which  do  set  limits  to  the  seriousness  of your  offence,  and  do  count  in  your  favour.  Your  gross  negligence  occurred  over  a period  which  can  be  measured  in  seconds:  it  was  not  a  prolonged  course  of  risk-taking.  You  were  not  motivated  by  financial  profit  or  self-advantage.    As  to  your  personal mitigation, you have never previously been convicted of any crime, and your  one  formal  police  caution  was  for  a  completely  different  type  of  offence  and  can  be  ignored  for  present  purposes.  Your  negligence  on  this  occasion  must  be  viewed  against the background of more than 20 years conscientious service on the railways. You  will  live  with  the  knowledge  of  what  you  did,  and  I  accept  that  will  be  a  heavy burden  to  you.  Your  conduct  has  resulted  in  your  suffering  post-traumatic  stress disorder: there is clear expert evidence that the symptoms of that disorder, together with severe anxiety and depression, still continue a year after the incident.  Lastly, for  a man of your age and position, any sentence of imprisonment will be difficult to bear, and I have no doubt you have dreaded this day. All  those  points  were  well  made  by  Mr  Birkett.   I  accept  that  individually  and    collectively  they  do  mitigate  your  crime.  But  I  have  to  have  regard  also  to  the  very grave harm that you caused, namely the death of a 16 year old girl.  Moreover, there are in my judgment five other serious and aggravating features of this offence.       Page 2 of 4      First, the evidence has plainly shown that throughout your career with Merseyrail you have been repeatedly trained and instructed in matters of safety.  You knew as well as anyone  the  risk  of  accidents  associated  with  what  has  been  referred  to  as  the  platform/train  interface.  You  must  also  have  known  that  a  passenger  who  falls  between platform and moving train is likely to be killed.  It follows that any risk you took in that area was a risk to the life of the passenger. Secondly, as the guard of the train, you were in complete control of the movement of the  train.  That  control  carries  with  it  the  direct  and  personal  responsibility  for  the  safety  of  passengers.    Much  has  been  made  on  your  behalf  during  this  trial  of  how  intoxicated Georgia Varley was, but that did not relieve you of the duty of care which you  owed  to  her.  You  alone  determined  whether  the  train  remained  stationary  or began  to  move.  Your  decision  and  your  action  determined  whether  Georgia  Varley was safe from risk. Thirdly, having heard all the evidence I am quite sure that you did in fact know that  Georgia Varley was heavily intoxicated.  You must surely have noticed at least some of her behaviour at Meols, when she left the train and was then brought back onto it by  a friend.  In any event the CCTV footage makes me sure that within moments of your seeing her on the platform at James St you must have known that she was unsteady on her feet.  You yourself confirmed to the police in interview that the last train into town on a Saturday night was looked on as a problem train because many passengers  had had too much to drink.  After 20 years’ experience of dealing with passengers, I am sure you sized up Georgia Varley’s condition almost at a glance. It follows that I am sure you knew she was particularly vulnerable to losing her balance.   That  being  so,  I  regard  it  as  a  fourth  serious  feature  of  the  case  that  you  were watching this vulnerable girl leaning against the side of the train, in the most obvious position of danger, when you pressed the bell twice to signal the driver to move the train.  You were not distracted at the vital moment, or required to turn away in order to operate the controls.  You had a continuous and perfect view of her: you were only about 25 metres apart, in a slightly elevated position and with nothing at all between you and her.  In my judgment, the CCTV footage is unequivocal: Georgia Varley was not moving away, and she was not showing any sign of moving away, when you gave Page 3 of 4   that  signal.  On  the  contrary,  she  was  leaning  against  and  supported  by  the  train which you chose to set in motion.  She only moved when the movement of the train  deprived her of that support and caused her to lose balance and fall to her death.  In the horror of realising what you had done you may later have persuaded yourself that you thought she was moving away, but I do not believe that you did think that at the time.  Georgia  Varley  had  done  nothing  to  give  you  any  reason  to  think  that.    I  am  satisfied that you merely hoped and assumed she would get out of the way when the  train  began  to  move,  and  on  that  wholly  inadequate  basis  you  took  a  terrible  risk. You completely ignored your repeated training and instruction to the effect that you must ensure it was safe to start the train before you gave the signal.    Lastly, even after you had given that signal, you could easily have countermanded it.  It would have been the work of a moment to give one more ring on the bell to signal the driver to stop before the train had really begun to move.  It would have taken only  seconds for you to step down from the cab, walk a few paces to where Georgia Varley was standing, and tell her to move away for her own safety.   But you did nothing.  I  take  into  account  all  those  features  of  the  case  which  I  have  mentioned,  both aggravating and mitigating As you have no doubt been advised, you will serve half of the sentence which I am about to pass.  You will then be released on licence for the remainder of the sentence, but you may be  returned to prison if you do not comply with the conditions of your licence. In my judgment, the least sentence which I can pass for this serious crime is one of 5 years’ imprisonment.                     The Hon. Mr Justice Holroyde 15th November, 2012 Page 4 of 4
