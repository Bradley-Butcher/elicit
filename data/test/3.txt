     Chester Crown Court     3 August 2012                                                                     Sentencing Remarks of Mr. Justice Roderick Evans   R   ‐v‐Iftikhar Ahmed    and   Farzana Ahmed     NOTE: there is an s.39 Order restricting reporting details relating to the youngest child, identified in   these remarks as X.   The jury has found you both guilty of the murder of your daughter Shafilea.  She was 17 years of   age when you killed her.  What was it that brought you two – her parents, the people who had   given her life – to the point of killing her?    You, Iftikhar Ahmed, came to the United Kingdom when you were 10 years of age and you are fully   familiar  with  western  culture.  Indeed,  you  married  a  Danish  woman  and  had  a  son  by  her  and  lived, for some time, in Denmark. Then, in 1985, you returned to Pakistan and, while you were   there,  you  married  Farzana  Ahmed,  your  first  cousin.  She  lived  in  your  home  village  in  rural  Pakistan.  She had no experience of western culture but in 1986 you both came to England and  settled  here.  You  have  lived  here  for  the  last  25  years.  When  you  arrived  here  you,  Farzana    Ahmed, were pregnant with Shafilea.  In due course, you had four other children, three daughters,   Alesha, Mevish and X and a son, Junyad.     You chose to bring up your family in Warrington but, although you lived in Warrington, your social    and cultural attitudes were those of rural Pakistan and it was those which you imposed upon your    children.   Shafilea was a determined, able and ambitious girl who wanted to live a life which was normal in  the country and in the town in which you had chosen to live and bring up your children.  However,  you  could  not  tolerate  the  life  that  Shafilea  wanted  to  live.  You  wanted  your  family  to  live  in  Pakistan in Warrington.  Although she went to local schools, you objected to her socialising with  girls  from  what  has  been  referred  to  as  “the  white  community”.  You  objected  to  her  wearing  western clothes and you objected to her having contact with boys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1      Chester Crown Court     3 August 2012                                                                     Sentencing Remarks of Mr. Justice Roderick Evans   R   ‐v‐Iftikhar Ahmed    and   Farzana Ahmed     NOTE: there is an s.39 Order restricting reporting details relating to the youngest child, identified in   these remarks as X.

Shafilea was a determined, able and ambitious girl who wanted to live a life which was normal in  the country and in the town in which you had chosen to live and bring up your children.

As to Junyad, he remains supportive, especially of you Iftikhar Ahmed.  Whether that is simply out   of filial affection or the result of the warped values you instilled in him, is impossible to tell.   There is only one sentence that I can impose upon you and that is a sentence of imprisonment for  life.  However, I have to set the minimum period that you must spend in custody before you can be   considered  for  parole.  That  has  to  be  done  in  accordance  with  the  sentencing  regime  which    applied  at the  time  you murdered Shafilea,  that  is,  that  which  applied  after  31st  May  2002  and    before 18th December 2003.   My first task is to identify the starting point for setting the minimum term.  In my judgment, your  culpability  can,  because  of  the  circumstances  of  the  murder,  properly  be  described  as   exceptionally high and, therefore, I take the higher starting point.    I then have to consider the aggravating and mitigating features of the case to adjust that starting   point appropriately ensuring, as I do, that the features which led me to adopt the higher starting  point, are not considered again as aggravating features, in a way which would unfairly inflate the   minimum term I set.    The  first  point  to  note  is,  of  course,  that  your  intention  was  to  kill  Shafilea.  That  is  not  an   aggravating  feature  but  it  means  that  there  can  be  no  mitigation  which  a  lesser  intent  would   attract.      Mitigating Features    I accept, subject to what I have said, that there was no pre‐existing plan to kill Shafilea that night.    The only other mitigating feature I can identify is the absence of previous convictions and that,   while not wholly irrelevant, can in the circumstances of this case, have but little influence on the   term I have to set.   Aggravating Features   I identify the following aggravating features in this case:                                                                                                                                                  You were the people to whom Shafilea should have been able to look for protection and   kindness.  Your treatment of her and your killing her was as fundamental a breach of trust    as can be imagined.                               You acted together as a team to kill her.             In  the  year  before  you  killed  Shafilea,  you  subjected  her  to  repeated  violence;  you   abducted her from the street on 10th  February, you drugged her to take her to Pakistan  and you tried to arrange a marriage for her which was against her will.                                        1.	   2.	  3.	   3        4.	     Shafilea was in a vulnerable condition when you killed her.  She was still weak from the   effects  of  the  ingestion  of  bleach  which  she  had  taken  to  try  to  avoid  what  you  had    planned for her in Pakistan.                                 5.	  A truly horrifying feature of this case is that you killed Shafilea in the presence of your                   other four children.     6.	 The killing was motivated by the cultural issues to which I have already referred.                7.	  After the killing, you concealed her body.           8.	  After  the  killing,  not  only  did  you  lie  and  mislead  people  to  cover  up  what  you  did,   including lying on oath before the Coroner, but you also made your surviving children put     forward an account which was intended to hide what you had done.                                                                                    I have considered the impact of Paragraph 10 of Schedule 22 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003.    There is no basis upon which I should differentiate between you.  The minimum term which in my   judgment adequately reflects the seriousness of this case in respect of each of you, is 25 years.    You will not be eligible to be considered for parole until you have served those 25 years in prison.     When you have done so, you will not be released automatically.  You will be released only when     the Parole Board is satisfied that you no longer present a danger.      The sentence, therefore, in respect of each of you is life imprisonment with a minimum term of 25   years from which will be deducted the number of days which you have served in custody during  this case.  In the case of each of you, I am told that you have been in custody for 66 days.  If that   figure proves inaccurate, it will be amended administratively.                                                                                                             4
