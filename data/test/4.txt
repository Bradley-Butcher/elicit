 The Queen   -v- Clayton Barker   Charlie  Chandler   Ben Potter   Jamie Chandler   Earl Bevans    Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Spencer        Luton Crown Court    Wednesday 6th January  2021       1.	  Clayton  Barker, Charlie  Chandler, Ben Potter, Jamie  Chandler and Earl Bevans, I have             to sentence each of you for two offences of murder and two offences of wounding  with            intent,  all  committed  within  the  space of a few minutes  around  midnight  on  Saturday              19th  October  2019.  Two of  your  victims  were  stabbed  to  death. The  other  two  were            stabbed but survived.  It is a dreadfully  serious case. You Earl Bevans pleaded guilty  to                all these offences on the first day of the trial, before the jury  was sworn. The other four                 of you were convicted  by the jury  after a trial lasting  seven weeks.            2.	  The five  of you  gate-crashed a 17th birthday  party at a house  in  Milton  Keynes, armed                 with  knives  and  machetes, and  with  masks  to  conceal  your  identity.  You  had  been              tipped  off that members of  the rival M4 gang were at the party and you  travelled  there                together  by  taxi.  Four  of you  climbed  over the  fence  into  the  back garden  and burst                1  into the house through  the conservatory. The fifth remained outside,  to intercept anyone              who  ran out  of the  house.  Ben Gilham-Rice  was stabbed  to death  in  the  living  room                whilst  the party was in full flow, in the presence of several teenage boys and girls.  Two                 other  victims  were  stabbed  in  the  house  but  fortunately  not  fatally.  Dom  Ansah             managed to run out of the house  but was chased, eventually  cornered, and brutally  and               mercilessly  stabbed some 35 times. He died  in hospital  three hours later.             3.	  For murder  there  is only  one  sentence for an adult:  imprisonment  for life.  That is  the               sentence which I shall pass upon  you, Charlie  Chandler  and you Earl Bevans. You are              both  over 21 years of age. Because you, Clayton  Barker, are still  only  20 years of age,               the  sentence  in  your  case has to  be  expressed as custody  for life.  Because you  Ben                 Potter, and you Jamie  Chandler, were under 18 years of age when you committed  these              murders,  the  sentence  in  your  case  has  to  be  expressed  as  detention  during  Her             Majesty’s pleasure. But make no mistake, the effect of the sentence for eachof you will              be the same. Each of you will  remain in  custody for very many years to come until  you                  have served the minimum  term which I am obliged  by law  to fix  in the case of each of                 you; thereafter you will  remain in custody until  such time as the Parole Board considers               it safe to release you. You will  then remain on licence  for the rest of your life,  liable  to                 be recalled to prison  if you commit  any further offence or breach the conditions  of your             4.	  No sentence I pass can reflect the depth of the grief suffered by the families  of the two                young  men whose lives  you took.  The families  have sat throughout  the seven weeks of               this  trial with enormous  dignity  as they tried  to understand  and come  to terms with  the                 horrifying  brutality  of  the  events  of  that  fateful  night.  In  their  moving  personal           statements read to the  court  they have  explained  the  devastating  impact  of  their  loss.             Ben Gilham-Rice  and Dom Ansah were both only  17 years old,  with  their  lives  ahead               of  them.  For  the  families  the  loss  of their  beloved  sons is  in  a  very  real sense a  life                    licence.   sentence.  5.	  The  all-too-familiar  background  to  these  senseless  and  tragic  killings  was  rivalry            between  gangs  of  young  men,  and  the  culture  of  violence  and  knives,  promoted  on             social  media.  Sadly,  Dom  Ansah  was  himself  caught  up  in  that  gang  culture,  as a               leading  member of M4. And it was through  his association  with Dom Ansah, albeit  not               2         a member  of the  gang himself,  that Ben Gilham-Rice  was at the  party that night  with               M4 gang members. But the violence  that night  escalated way beyond anything  that had               gone  before.   6.	  You Clayton  Barker, Ben Potter and Jamie  Chandler  were enthusiastic  members of the            rival  B3  gang.  You  Charlie  Chandler  and Earl Bevans  were not  members  of  B3, but              you were closely  associated with those who were, and willing  to lend your support  that               night  in this revenge  attack as part of the ongoing  feud.           7.	  In September  2017,  you  Ben Potter were subjected  at the  age of  14  to  a vicious  and                degrading  assault at the hands of members of the M4 gang, including  Dom Ansah. You              were beaten and stripped.  A video  clip  of you  naked and bloodied  was widely  shared               on social media. I have  no doubt  that this  episode  traumatised  you deeply  and left you                with a sense of understandable  grievance.        8.	  In  April  2019,  just  six  months  before  these  murders,  you  Jamie  Chandler  were  the              victim  of gang violence  when you  were attacked in  broad  daylight  and stabbed  in  the               lower back. You had no choice  but to report the matter to the  police,  who had already                been called to the scene, but you  were unable  or unwilling  to identify  your attackers. It               is plain  that those responsible  were members of M4. The widely  circulating  belief aired             on social media  was, rightly  or wrongly,  that Dom Ansah was responsible.              9.	  I have no doubt  that these two incidents  fuelled  the desire on the part of members of B3                to have their revenge on members of M4 if and when a suitable  opportunity  arose. That               is undoubtedly  the  background  to these horrific  offences.          10.	  In fixing  the minimum  term which each of you must serve before you are eligible  even                to be considered  for release by the Parole Board, I am required to take into  account the                seriousness  of  these  two  offences  of  murder  and  the  two  associated  offences  of          wounding  with  intent.  I am required  to have regard to the  general principles  set out in                Schedule  21  to  the  Criminal  Justice  Act 2003,  now  re-enacted in  Schedule  21  to  the                Sentencing  Act 2020.  In your case Earl Bevans, because you were convicted before 1st                December 2020, the 2003  Act applies. In the case of the other four of you, because you             were convicted  after that date, the 2020  Act applies.  There is no material difference in               the provisions  of the two statutes.       3          11. In the  case of the  three adult  defendants  it  is  common  ground  that because you  have                been  convicted  of two  murders  committed  after you  had  attained  the  age  of  18,  the             starting  point  set  by  parliament  for  your  minimum  term  is  30  years,  which  is  the              equivalent  of  a  determinate  sentence  of  60  years.  In  the  case  of  the  two  juvenile               defendants, the starting  point  set by parliament  for your minimum  term irrespective  of           the number of murders  is 12 years, the equivalent  of a determinate  sentence of 24 years.            It is  rightly  conceded on  your  behalf  that  there  must  be  a  significant  uplift  from  the               starting  point  of  12  years  to  reflect  the  fact  that  you  are  being  sentenced  for  two               murders.  12. Before turning  to  the  aggravating  and mitigating  factors requiring  departure  from  the             starting  points  set by Parliament,  and to the individual  circumstances of each of you, it              is necessary for me to set out briefly  my findings  of fact on the evidence.              13. I have no doubt  that it was you, Clayton  Barker, who received the tip  off that members                 of M4  were at the  party. That  message came  late  in  the  evening,  shortly  after 11pm.               You were then at Charlie  Chandler’s  flat,  23 Fitzwilliam  Street. Directly  or indirectly             contact was made  with  Jamie  Chandler  and Ben Potter who were at Jamie  Chandler’s             home,  where  they  had  been  joined  by  Earl  Bevans.  At  just  before  11.15pm  Jamie               Chandler  and  Ben Potter were recording  a  clip  of themselves  rapping,  in  which  Ben            Potter  was  talking  about  “boring”,  which  is  slang  for  stabbing,  and  asking  Jamie            Chandler  where his  mask was, to which  the reply  was “in  the garage”. Jamie  Chandler               then phoned  for a taxi, a seven seater, to take the three of them to 23 Fitzwilliam  Street,               to  pick  up  Charlie  Chandler  and  Clayton  Barker. I  have  no  doubt  that  you,  Clayton              Barker were taking  the lead  in  this  expedition  to mount  a surprise  attack on members               of the M4 gang at the party.       14. On the way to the  house  in  Archford Croft where the  party was in  full  swing,  the  taxi                   was directed  to  stop  off at some  garages in  Braybrook  Drive  for  what can only  have               been  the  purpose  of  obtaining  weapons  or  further  weapons.  You,  Charlie  Chandler,          knew the house  in  Archford Croft from the  outside  at least, from  previous  visits.  You                stayed outside  whilst  the  other four  went over the  back gate, into  the  garden and then              rushed  into  the  house  through  the  conservatory,  armed  with  weapons  and  wearing             masks.   4          15. I am quite  sure on the evidence  that, with the exception  of Charlie  Chandler,  all four of              you  went into  the  house,  and  that  you  did  so intending  to  take  part in  attacking  and                  inflicting  serious  injury  on  any  members  of  M4  who were  present. You, Ben  Potter,              were  distinctive  not  least  because  of  your  small  stature.  On  its  own  the  voice             identification  by Olivia  Burgess might  not have been sufficiently  reliable,  but  coupled             with  the description  of your appearance, by her and other witnesses inside  the  house, I           am quite  sure  that you  spoke  to her, asking  if  she wanted to be  stabbed, and  that you                  had a large  knife  which  you were trying  to conceal in  your waistband.              16. Within  seconds of you all entering  the house, Ben Gilham-Rice  was repeatedly stabbed             in the living  room, in full  view of the terrified  teenagers. There were six separate sharp                force injuries,  including  four stab wounds. The fatal wound  to his chest penetrated to a                depth  of 20  cm and pierced the  heart. There was a  second stab wound close  by which                 cut through the sixth rib and penetrated to a depth of 8 cm. There was also a stab wound                     17 cm deep to the  back of his  right  thigh.  The clear inference  is that Ben Gilham-Rice                  was stabbed by more than one person. He died within  minutes  from massive  blood  loss.                 17. Ryan Brown was stabbed in  the left side  of the chest, with sufficient  force to fracture a                  rib.  There was a laceration  to his  spleen  and a contusion  to his  lung.  He was standing                   just  outside  the  front  door  when  he  was  stabbed;  the  person  who  did  it  clearly               recognised him as a member or associate of M4, and said his name “Ryan” immediately              before stabbing  him.  Ryan Brown fled from the house  and escaped further attack. Tom              Honhold  was also  stabbed in  the house,  receiving  a  wound  to his  right  arm and  a cut                  above his right  hip. He too fled from the house, and was pursued for some distance, but                 he too escaped further attack.     18. Dom  Ansah ran out  of the  house  when he  realised  what was happening.  It is entirely                possible  that he received some of his stab wounds in the house, but when he ran outside                 he managed to keep ahead of his  pursuers. This  part of the incident  is clearly  shown in                the  dash cam footage  from  a taxi parked outside  the  house. Although  there was much                discussion  and  argument  during  the  trial  about  the  identity  of  the  two  defendants             chasing  Dom  Ansah and Tom  Honhold,  I am quite  sure on  all  the  evidence  that you,                Jamie  Chandler, were male  3 leading  the chase, and you, Clayton  Barker, were male  4                 5       who joined  him  and revived  Jamie  Chandler’s  interest  in  the  chase when he  hesitated               momentarily.  19. The dash camfootage shows Dom Ansah running  back towards the house a few seconds                 later, closely  pursued by the two of you. He slipped  and lost  his footing  for a moment,                thereby  enabling  the  two of you  to catch up with  him.  There  followed  an appalling ly               brutal sustained  attack on Dom Ansah, close  to the  house, in  which  he was repeatedly                stabbed  and  subjected  to  chopping  injuries  from  a  machete.  There  were  some  35              separate sharp force injuries.  The number and distribution  of those injuries  leads to the             sure  inference  that two or  more  of  you  joined  in  the  frenzied  attack. The  fatal injury               was a stab wound  to the  back which  penetrated the  left  lung  with  a  track depth  of 15                   cm. There  was a  chop  wound  to  the  back  of the  left  shoulder  which  almost  split  the                 bony  process of the  shoulder  blade.  There was a classic  defence injury  to the left hand                 which  split  the  bone  of the  little  finger.  As the  pathologist  explained,  there must  have               been some hard surface against which  the hand was struck, the anvil  effect as he called                 it, and he demonstrated  how this would  have been caused with the hands protecting  the                head. There were other defence injuries to the hand where Dom Ansah had tried to grab                the knife  or knives  being  used against  him.  There were stab wounds  to the back, to the                 chest, and to the left thigh.       20. This  attack was witnessed  in  part by a  neighbour  watching  from  his  window  nearby,                although  his view was somewhat impeded.  He described his growing horror at realising             that the  victim  of the attack was being  struck repeatedly with  a machete brought  down               on him.  What he saw that night  will stay with him  for ever. He saw at least three people                   taking  part in  the  attack. I am quite  sure on  the evidence  that you  Clayton  Barker and                you Jamie  Chandler  were two of those  three.       21. I cannot be sure on all the evidence that it was you, Charlie  Chandler, who was wielding                  the  machete. But I am quite  sure that you were no mere  spectator whilst the  attack on               Dom  Ansah  was taking  place.  You  were  there  close  by,  ready  to  lend  assistance  if                necessary and I am sure, as a matter of inference  on all the  evidence, that you were in                 possession  of a weapon of some  kind  at the  scene, in all probability  a knife.  You were                the  only  defendant to give  evidence.  You denied  that your  role  was to cover the  front               door  and intercept  anyone  from M4 who ran out of the  house, but  I am sure  on all the                  6  evidence that this was indeed your role. You accepted in cross examination  that it would                make  no  sense  for  anyone  playing  that  role  not  to  be  armed.  You  could  give  no                explanation  for  what  you  were  doing  with  your  right  hand,  apparently  fiddling  with            your  sleeve, when you  walked  away from  the house  and turned  to face the  camera in                the dash cam footage.  I am sure you  were concealing  a weapon. I am sure as well that                 you had taken a face covering with you, giving  the lie  to the suggestion  that you had no                    idea  of what was afoot until  you  saw the  others  put on masks  and begin  to climb  over                  the  fence. I am quite  sure that you  knew perfectly  well  from the  outset  what the  plan                 was and that you were encouraging  and supporting  the attacks.            22. The  five  of you stayed together immediately  after the  attacks. At one stage or another             you disposed  of the clothing  you  had been wearing.  Some clothing  was burnt  at Jamie                 Chandler’s  home,  along  with  a  mobile  phone.  Only  one  knife  was ever  recovered,             which  was put  down  a drain  by  Furzton  Lake.  That knife  must  have  come  from  your                 home,  Jamie  Chandler,  and may  well have  been taken to the  scene by  Earl Bevans. I                am quite  sure that Daniel Freeman was telling  the truth in  describing  how you, Clayton                Barker, told him  you had disposed  of a large knife  or “Rambo sword”  by Furzton Lake,                 but had retained the sheath which went with it. With considerable  courage and presence               of mind,  Daniel Freeman made an excuse to leave his flat and summon  the police  when                you confessed to him.       23. I  am  also  quite  sure  on  the  evidence  that  you,  Jamie  Chandler,  confessed  to  Chloe               Congdon  that you had been involved  in the stabbings, and showed her the blood  staining               on your tracksuit bottoms.  You, Ben Potter, confessed to her as well.  I am sure too that               you, Ben Potter, were boasting  to Katie Dart that you had taken part in the killings.                 24. You  Clayton  Barker, wrote  about  the  killings  and  your  part in  them  in  the  rap lyrics                found  in your diary. You may have been imitating  the style  of others more famous, but               I have  no  doubt  that you  were  describing  real events  and  revelling  in  what  you  had                done. One  passage in  particular,  at tab 16 page  F of the  jury  bundle,  describes  all too                 graphically  the  stabbing  of  Dom Ansah, whom  you said you  “kept knifing”,  as well as                Tom  Honhold  and  Ryan  Brown.  You  Ben  Potter  recorded  yourself  rapping  and           describing  how you had stabbed one of the victims  (“drilling”).                 7  25. As well  as sentencing  each of  you  for  two  murders,  I have  to  sentence  you  for  two               further  offences  of  wounding  with  intent.  It  is  common  ground  that  the  appropriate            course  is to reflect the additional  criminality  of those  offences in  fixing  the  minimum              term for the offences of murder, and to impose  concurrent sentences for the offences of            wounding.  Applying  the  relevant  Sentencing  Council  guideline,  it  is  common  ground            that  these  offences would  each be  classified  as category  two,  lesser  harm  but  higher              culpability,  indicating  a starting  point  of six  years custody  after trial.  The  appropriate            determinate  sentence  has to  be  halved  in  adding  it  into  the  minimum  term,  and  the                principle  of totality  must also be observed.       26. There are a number  of aggravating  factors common  to all of you, which  would  justify              an increase of the starting  points  in  schedule  21. Some  of the factors overlap.             27. First, I am satisfied  that there was a significant  degree of planning  and premeditation.  I              accept that the opportunity  for this  ambush attack arose spontaneously  on the night,  but              there was a hastily  conceived plan to attend this party, armed with weapons and wearing                 masks, in  order to  take  the  rival  gang  members  by surprise  and  inflict  serious  injury                 upon them. It is different, for example  from a situation  where one gang,  out looking  for               trouble,  comes across a  rival  gang  and  engages  spontaneously  in  fighting.  Here this              house  was targeted specifically  because M4 were there. The attack may not  have been               long  in  the planning  but it was planning  and premeditation  to a significant  degree.                 28. Second, this was a group attack, by five  defendants,  a classic  joint  enterprise.               29. Third,  the  attack and  the  killings  took  place  at a private  house  in  full  view  of a large                  number  of  young  people,  causing  untold  trauma  to  those  who  witnessed  it  as  their             evidence  and demeanour  in the witness box demonstrated.        30. Fourth,  knives  and deadly weapons were carried to the scene. Even for a single  offence               of  murder,  the  starting  point  for  an adult  would  have  been 25  years on  that account               alone.  31. Fifth,  there  was mental  and  physical  suffering  inflicted  specifically  on  Dom  Ansah             before death. He was chased, running  quite  literally  for his life.  There was a prolonged                attack during  which he was fully  conscious,  even finding  the strength, quite  remarkably,                           8  to get up  and knock  on  the door  of the  house  before  he collapsed  in  the  sitting  room.                He survived  for a further three hours. It is clear from his  mother’s evidence  that at the               hospital  he  was well  aware of the  seriousness  of  his  injuries  and expected to  die.  He               was also greatly  distressed by  knowledge  of the  death of his friend  Ben Gilham-Rice,             whose own suffering  was cut short by his swift loss of consciousness.            32.	  Sixth,  successful  efforts  were  made  to  dispose  of  clothing  and  weapons,  with  the             intention  of avoiding  detection.    33. All  these aggravating  factors must  be  reflected in  the minimum  term for each of you,              together  with  the  additional  criminality  of  the  separate  offences  of  wounding  with          intent.    34. The  aggravating  factors have  to be  balanced, however, against  the  mitigating  factors.             They vary for each of you. There  is the  additional  complication  of the  gross disparity             in starting  points  as between the two juvenile  defendants (12 years) and the three adult               defendants  (30  years), reflecting  the  disparity  in  your  ages and the  impact  of  that on              your respective  culpability.  This  makes it a particularly  difficult  case to sentence.             35. I have  considered  carefully  all the  authorities  referred to in  counsel’s  written  and oral              submissions.  In particular,  I have regard to the guidance  in the leading  case of R v Peters               [2005] EWCA Crim 605; [2005] 2 Cr App R (S) 101, and the importance  of recognising           the need for flexibility  in applying  the Schedule  21 starting points  to young  people,  for              whom  there  is  no  step  change  in  the  level  of  maturity  and  responsibility  simply  by               attaining  the age of 18 or 21.      36. It has  been submitted  by  counsel  that  an  important  common  mitigating  factor is  the             absence of an intention  to kill,  as opposed to an intention  to cause serious bodily  harm.                 I am prepared  to accept that because it  is  impossible  to know  who  inflicted  the  fatal                 stab wounds,  it is  impossible  to say which  if any of you intended  to kill  rather than to                cause really  serious injury.  However, where there is such a sustained  and frenzied  joint                attack, as there  was  on  Dom  Ansah, the  difference  between the  two  intentions  pales               almost  into  insignificance.                   9  37. Nor is  any  real distinction  to  be  drawn, on  the  facts of  this  case, between those  who                 physically  took part in stabbing  the two victims  who died, and those  who may not have                 stabbed but encouraged the others. By their verdicts, applying  and following  the  Steps             to Verdict  documents  for each of you,  the  jury  must  have  concluded  that each of you              fell into  one or other of these categories.      38. In the  case of each of you  the  minimum  term will  run from  today,  and you  will  have                 credit for the time  already served on remand before trial and following  conviction.             39. I bear in mind  that the last 9 months  of the time  you have served already has been made                  more  difficult  by  the restrictions  imposed  by the Covid-19  pandemic.  That is likely  to               remain the case for several months  to come.        40. The surcharge provisions  apply to this case and the order can be drawn up accordingly.               41. With those general observations, I turn to consider the individual  circumstances of each           of you.  I have considered  carefully  all the  written  and oral submissions  made by  your              counsel.   Clayton Barker   42. I deal first  with  you,  Clayton  Barker. You are now 20  years old.  At the  time  of these                  offences you were aged 19 years 6 months.  At the age of 15 you were made the subject                   of a referral order for offences of robbery, but I do not treat that as an aggravating factor.              For the  reasons I have already  explained,  I am satisfied  that you played  a leading  role              in  this  joint  enterprise. As the  independent  evidence  of the  taxi driver  confirmed,  the             others looked  to you  as the  leader. You were steeped in  the  gang  culture  of B3 to the                  point  of obsession,  preoccupied with  violence  and knives.  You were one of those who              entered the house. If you did  not yourself take part in the stabbing  of Ben Gilham-Rice              you must have been very close to it and encouraging  it. By your own admission  in your                  diary,  you stabbed Ryan Brown and Tom  Honhold,  and I am quite  sure you  played  an                active  physical leading  role  in  stabbing  Dom Ansah outside  the house.            43.	  I have read the impressive  letters from your uncle  and your grandmother,  and the letter               which  you  have  written  yourself.  I accept that you  had  a  very troubled  and  deprived               upbringing,  born  to a  14 year old  mother  who  was never able  or willing  to look  after              10           you  properly.  Your  grandmother  brought  you  up  and  there  remains  a  strong  bond            between you,  as there is with your  uncle  too.  Your childhood  was blighted  by tragedy.              Your father committed  suicide  when you were only  seven or eight years old.  It was you              who found  him  hanging.  Such events have scarred you  emotionally.  I accept that you              looked  to B3 almost as your  substitute  family.  The writings  in your diary  do not, in my                judgement,  suggest  a  lack of  maturity  or intelligence.  You  knew perfectly  well  what            you were doing  that night  when you led B3 into  this fatal confrontation.                       44. I accept that, as you sayin your letter, you are genuinely  remorseful, and you understand               the  pain  and grief  of the  families  of your  victims.  The  clearest expression  of remorse           would have been a guilty  plea. I accept that the period you have already spent in custody                  has provided  the stability  which your  life  has lacked for so  long.            45.	  The  strongest  mitigation  in  your  case is  your  comparative  youth,  coupled  with  your           troubled  upbringing.  You  were  still  only  19  years  old  when  these  offences  were              committed,  and that requires me to make a significant  reduction  from the starting point                which  would  otherwise  be  appropriate  after  an  increase  to  reflect  the  aggravating            factors.  46. The  minimum  term in  your  case will  be  28 years. There  will  be  concurrent  sentences               of six  years custody for each of the offences of wounding  with intent.            47. Stand up please. Clayton  Barker, for the offences of murder, counts  1 and 2, I sentence              you  to custody  for life,  with  a minimum  term of  28  years from  today,  less 411  days                already  served.  On  counts  3  and  4,  there  will  be  concurrent  sentences  of  six  years               detention  in a young  offender institution.       Charlie  Chandler   48.	  I turn to you,  Charlie  Chandler. You are now just 23 years old. You were aged 21 years                    9  months  at  the  time  of  these  offences.  You  have  no  previous  convictions.  For  the              reasons I have already explained  I am satisfied that you played a full part in encouraging               these attacks; your  role  was to remain  outside  the house  to lend  assistance if required.              You did not take part physically  in the stabbings  inside  the house. Nor can I be sure that                 you physically  took part in the stabbing  of Dom Ansah outside  the house. Nevertheless,              you were close  by when that stabbing  took  place and you encouraged all the stabbings                 11  by your  willingness  to take part in  this  plan to ambush  and inflict  really  serious injury                on those  believed  to be members of M4 who were present at the party. It may well be                 that part of your motivation  was revenge for the stabbing  of your younger  brother Jamie         Chandler  six  months  earlier.  But  that provided  no  excuse  whatsoever for the  horrific           attacks to which you lent  your support.       49. I had the opportunity  of observing  you in the witness box over a period  of several days.               You are an intelligent  and resourceful young  man. You made no effort to dissuade  your                younger  brother  from  involvement  in  this  criminal  venture.  You  were not  lacking  in            maturity.  50. In your case too, the  strongest mitigation  is your  comparative  youth,  coupled  with  the             secondary  role  which  you  played,  albeit  a  very serious  role.  I also  have  to  ensure, in                sentencing  all of you, that there is no unfair disparity  between the minimum  terms you              are required  to serve, beyond  the disparity  which  necessarily  flows  from  the different              starting  points  for each of you under schedule  21.       51. The  minimum  term in  your  case will  be  27 years. There  will  be  concurrent  sentences               of six  years imprisonment  for each of the two offences of wounding  with intent.           52. Stand up please. Charlie  Chandler, for each of the offences of murder,  counts 1 and 2,              I sentence you to imprisonment  for life,  with  a minimum  term of 27 years from today,              less 439  days already  served. On counts  3 and 4 there  will  be  concurrent sentences of                six years imprisonment.       Earl Bevans   53. I  deal next  with  you,  Earl Bevans.  You  are  now  23  years old.  At the  time  of  these                  offences you  were aged 22  years 6  months,  the  oldest  of all  the  defendants.  You had                 previous  convictions  for battery, in  the context  of domestic  violence,  and resisting  the            police,  for which  you  were made  the subject  of a community  order in  2018  at the age               of 21. However, I do not treat those convictions  as an aggravating  factor.             54. You had no direct  affiliation  to the  B3 gang, save your friendship  with  Ben Potter and                Jamie  Chandler,  who  were  several  years  your  junior,  and  your  acquaintance  with           Clayton  Barker.  Nevertheless  you  willingly  went  along  with  this  criminal  venture,             12          seemingly  to  avenge  the  previous  stabbing  of  Jamie  Chandler  and  the  humiliat ing           assault and degradation  of Ben Potter. I am quite  sure that you went armed with a knife,                which  was later disposed  of in  the  drain  near Furzton  Lake. You  are one  of  the  four              who  entered the  house. You  admitted  in  your  second defence  statement that you  had              stabbed both Ben Gilham-Rice  and Dom Ansah, although  at that stage you were falsely                suggesting  you  were  in  some  way acting  in  self-defence.  Nothing  could  have  been              further  from  the  truth.  By  your  participation  in  the  stabbings  you  were  strongly              encouraging  those who inflicted  the fatal injuries.        55.	  The  greatest mitigation  in  your  case is  that  you  pleaded  guilty  to  all  these  offences,               albeit  only  on  the  first  day  of  the  trial.  In  accordance  with  the  Sentencing  Council               guideline  on reduction  in sentence for a guilty  plea, the maximum  credit I should  afford              you is one-twentieth.  As I observed at the time  you entered those guilty  pleas, to do so                 required  some  courage  and  is  the  best  demonstration  of  your  genuine  remorse.           However, in addition  to allowing  you  the prescribed one-twentieth  credit for plea, it is              appropriate  also  to  reflect  to  a  modest  extent,  as  part  of  your  general  personal             mitigation,  the remorse exemplified  by your pleas. Although  you denied these offences            throughout  your  police  interviews,  there  was a creeping  acceptance of your  guilt  over            the  months  leading  up  to  the  trial:  first  in  your  admission  to  the  psychiatrist  in               November  2019  of taking  some  part in  the stabbings,  echoed in  your  revised defence            statement in  January 2020. Then in the week before the trial you made it plain  to those                   representing  you  that you  wished to plead guilty  to all counts without  prevarication.  It               was necessary for counsel  to see you  and  confirm  your  instructions,  and that process             could  not be completed  until  the day before your pleas were entered.            56. The  other  mitigation  advanced in  your  case derives  from the  psychiatric  report  dated             23rd  March 2020. Whilst  not affording  you any partial defence to murder, it is clear that                you  were suffering  from  an emotionally  unstable  personality  disorder  associated with           traits of antisocial  personality  disorder.  This  is likely  to have  led  to some  impairment              of your  judgement  and  actions at the material  time.  Although  I take  it into  account, it              does  not  in  my  view  reduce  your  culpability  to  any  significant  extent.  You  knew              perfectly well what you were doing  and how serious it was.                  13      57. Had you been convicted  after a trial your minimum  term would  have been 29 years. To                reflect  your  guilty  plea  and  the  additional  mitigation  of  your  genuine  remorse,  the           minimum  term in  your case will  be 27 years. There will  be concurrent sentences of six               years imprisonment  for the offences of wounding  with  intent.        58. Stand  up  please. Earl  Bevans, for  each of  the  offences of  murder,  counts  1  and  2, I              sentence you  to imprisonment  for life  with  a  minimum  term of  27  years from  today,              less  438  days  already  served.  On counts  3  and 4  there  will  be  concurrent  terms  of  6                 years imprisonment.    Ben Potter   59. I deal next with you, Ben Potter. You are now 17 years old.  At the time  of the offences                   you  were  aged  16  years  2  months.  You  have  only  one  previous  finding  of  guilt,              possessing a knife  in a public  place, for which you were made the subject of a 12 month                 referral order in February 2019.  These offences were committed  during  the currency of            that order.   60. You were an enthusiastic  member of B3. For the reasons already explained,  I am quite             sure  that  you  were one  of  the  four  who  went into  the  house,  and  sure  that you  were                 armed with a large  knife.  I am sure on the evidence  that you  were physically  involved                in  at least one  of the  fatal stabbings.  You were boasting  of it in  the rap you  recorded a                 month  later when you  were on the run, and you  were boasting  of it to Katie  Dart only                hours after the  murders.  By your  participation  in  the attacks you  were encouraging  all             the stabbings,  with the  intention  that really  serious harm should  be inflicted.  I have no               doubt  that your  motivation  related  to the  traumatic  experience  of  the  assault you  had             suffered yourself  at the hands of M4 two years earlier. But that did  not begin  to justify                your participation  in these murders.     61. Your culpability  has to be  judged  in  the light  of the  fact that you were only  just  16 at                   the  time  of the  offences. You  were in  the company  of  three  much older  defendants. I             have  considered  carefully  the  psychology  assessment report dated 31st  January 2020,            and  the  insight  it  gives  into  your  troubled  upbringing  and  early involvement  in  gang              culture.  That  report was prepared principally  for the  purpose  of establishing  whether          you  required  an  intermediary  for  the  trial.  You  did  not.  In  her  written  and  oral               14  submissions  your counsel  outlined  in  detail  the background  set out  in  the  report. As a                very  young  child  you  witnessed domestic  violence  and  you  never had  the  consistent             support of a male father figure. You suffered from anxiety and depression  from an early              age. You  first  joined  a  gang  at the  age  of  12,  at a  time  when you  were  particularly                  vulnerable.  When  you  joined  the  rival  B3  gang,  you  suffered  the  humiliating  and              traumatic  assault  soon  after your  14th  birthday  to  which  I have  already  referred. That            led to further anxiety  and depression, and panic  attacks. You twice made some  attempt               at suicide.  You did  not engage  fully  with  the mental health  service  to which you  were                 referred by the youth offending  team in 2019.  All this  sad background  reduces to some                extent your culpability  for these very serious offences, but I am quite  satisfied that your             culpability  remains  high  despite  this  and  despite  your  young  age.  You  had  become             streetwise, and the  picture  of  your  involvement  in  the  offences which  was painted  in             the evidence does not suggest that you were particularly  immature.  You knew perfectly              well what you  were doing,  and how serious  it was.            62.	  The  starting  point  of 12 years must  be  very substantially  increased  to reflect the  fact                 that you have been convicted of two murders and two offences of wounding  with intent.              I have already identified  the aggravating  factors common  to all of you.  I accept in  your              case, as in  the case of the others, that there may not have been an intention  to kill,  but                   the  ferocity  of  the  two  fatal attacks was so  great that  the  mitigation  of  that  point  is                limited.  Whilst  in  custody you  have behaved well and made good  progress with  your                  studies,  which  is  to  your  credit.  I  take  fully  into  account  your  young  age  and  your              troubled  background.   63. The  minimum  term in  your  case will  be  22 years. There  will  be  concurrent  sentences               of four years detention  for the two offences of wounding  with intent.         64. Stand  up  please.  Ben  Potter,  for  each of  the  offences  of  murder,  counts  1  and  2,  I              sentence you to be detained  during  Her Majesty’s pleasure, with a minimum  term of 22              years  from  today  less  432  days  already  served.  On  counts  3  and  4  there  will  be                 concurrent  sentences of four years detention,  pursuant  to s.250 of the  Sentencing  Act                  2020.   15   Jamie Chandler   65. I turn  finally  to  you,  Jamie  Chandler.  You  are just  17  years old.  At  the  time  of  the                  offences you  were aged 15  years 9 months.  You are therefore  the  youngest  of all  the                 defendants. You have  no previous  convictions.  However, despite  your young  age and            good  character you took  a particularly  prominent  part in  these stabbings.  You were an               enthusiastic  member of B3 and subscribed to all it stood for. You ordered the taxi which               took the five of you to Archford Croft. That phone  call was played during  the trial. You                 sounded  calm  and self-assured, although  you  knew perfectly  well  what was planned.             As I have  already  explained,  I am  quite  sure  that  you  were male  3  in  the  dash  cam                 footage, chasing Dom Ansah in company with Clayton  Barker. You  were armed with a               large knife. I am sure on all the evidence that you were one of the three who were taking                  part physically  in  the  horrific  sustained  attack on Dom  Ansah outside  the house  when               he was finally  cornered. You admitted  to Chloe  Congdon  only  hours later that you had               been involved  in  the killings.      66.	  Your culpability  has to be assessed in the light  of the fact that you were only  15 years                   9  months  old  at  the  time  of  the  offences.  I  bear  in  mind  the  Sentencing  Council              guideline:  overarching  principles  for sentencing  children  and young  people.  I note  in           particular  the sound general advice  that children  and young  people  are unlikely  to have              the  same experience  and capacity  as an adult  to understand  the  effect of  their  actions              on  other  people,  or to  appreciate  the  pain  and  distress  caused, and  a  child  or  young              person may be less able  to resist temptation,  especially  where peer pressure is  exerted.              It is said  on your  behalf  that the  fact that you  yourself  had been stabbed but survived               effectively  unscathed  may  have  lessened  your  appreciation  of  the  potentially  fatal          consequences  of such  stabbings.  I  find  that impossible  to accept. You  are clearly  an             intelligent  young  man. You must have known  that multiple  stabbings  of a victim  were              likely  to risk not merely really  serious injury  but death. I am quite  sure that the fact that                  you  yourself  had been  stabbed was a powerful  motivating  factor in  your  willingness           and enthusiasm  to take part in  these very serious  offences. I am sure that you believed                Dom Ansah to have  been involved  in  your stabbing,  as was generally  the  word on the                street on social media.        16  67. Following  your  own  stabbing,  your  mother  warned  you  of  the  consequences  of         continuing  to involve  yourself  in  this  gang culture,  as the extracts from  text messages              between the two of you clearly  show. You chose to ignore  that advice  and continued  to                embrace  the  gang  culture  wholeheartedly.  You  had  done  well  at school  until  2018,              excelling  in  film  and  media  studies,  which  no  doubt  accounts  in  part  for  the             professionalism  of the B3 gang video. I accept that you had lost your way, dropping  out              of school,  but  I cannot  accept that you  were immature  for your  age. Like  Ben Potter             you  had become  streetwise. I am satisfied  that  your  culpability  remains  high  despite            your young  age and troubled  background.      68. The starting point  of 12 years must be very substantially  increased in your case as well,               to  reflect the  fact that  you  have  been convicted  of two  murders  and  two  offences of               wounding  with intent. I have already identified  the aggravating  factors common  to you             all.  I accept that the time  you have already spent in custody,  and the experience  of this                trial,  has altered  your  view  of  the  gang  culture  in  which  you  had  become  immersed.              That cannot alter the seriousness  of your culpability.        69. The  minimum  term  in  your  case will  be  22  years. For  the  two offences of wounding              with intent  there will  be concurrent sentences of four years detention.          70. Stand up please. Jamie  Chandler, for each of the two offences of murder, counts 1 and              2, I sentence you  to be detained  during  Her Majesty’s  pleasure, with  a minimum  term              of 22 years from today, less 418 days you have already served. On counts 3 and 4 there                   will  be  concurrent  terms of  four years detention,  pursuant  to s.250  of the  Sentencing            Act 2020.             17
