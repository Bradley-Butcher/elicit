  The Queen -v-Ben Bamford  Lewes Crown Court 23rd November 2016    Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Spencer  1. Ben Bamford, I have to sentence you for the brutal murder of Paul Jefferies in his  own home on the night of 23rd February 2016. For murder there is only one sentence   prescribed by law: life imprisonment. Because you were under 18 years of age when  you committed this murder your life sentence has to be expressed as detention at Her Majesty’s  Pleasure.  That  is  the  sentence  I  shall  pass  in  due  course,  But  I    am  also required first to determine the minimum period you must serve in custody before you are even eligible to be considered for release on parole. 2.  You  were  convicted  by  the  jury  after  a  two  week  trial.  Your  defence  was  that  the killing was the result of an excusable loss of control which should reduce murder to manslaughter. The jury rejected that defence on the clearest evidence.    3.  The  man  you  murdered,  Paul  Jefferies,  was  52  years  old.  He  held  a  responsible  position  as  a  senior  civil  servant  working  for  HM  Revenue  and  Customs  as  a  policy  advisor  on  taxation  matters,  writing  submissions  for  Ministers.  It  is  evident  that  he  was good at his job and was well regarded. He was a shy man and a very private man.  Sadly he had lost contact with his family many years ago. That rift seems to date back     to  his  student  days  when  they  were  unable  to  come  to  terms  with  his  declared   sexuality as  a gay  man.  Following the breakdown of a long standing relationship he  moved  from  London  to  Sussex,  purchasing  a  cottage  in  the  village  of  Mayfield.  It  is      1 clear that he had spent a great deal of time and effort making his home comfortable. He commuted to London, where he worked long hours.   4. You first met Paul Jefferies through a gay dating website when you were still only  15 years old. In order to access that website you had to declare that you were over 18,   and you made that declaration falsely. Paul Jefferies must have known that you were  under  18  because  you  were  still  at  school  when  you  met  him,  studying  for  examinations  and  living  at  home  with  your  parents.  However,  you  accepted  in   evidence that you had  never told him your real age, and in particular that you were   then still under 16.  5. It is apparent from the exchanges of text messages which the jury were shown that   even at that early stage, aged 15, you saw your relationship with Paul Jefferies as an   opportunity to obtain money from him. He was taken by surprise when you asked, in  one message, if you could have a little money. You reassured him that you meant you  simply wanted to borrow £10; you were not requesting that he pay you for anything  which was going on between you. I accept, as I am sure the jury did, that there was a  degree of sexual intimacy between you and Paul Jefferies in the summer of 2014 over  a  period  of  several  weeks,  but  that  came  to  an  end  a  few  days  before  your  16th   birthday when you told Paul Jefferies in terms, in a text message, that although you       thought  he  was  really  nice,  you  were  just  not  gay.  He  assured  you  that  it  was   absolutely fine; he had enjoyed meeting you, and if it helped clarify things for you, he was glad; you should feel free to contact him about anything at any time.   6. It was more than 17 months later that you made contact with him again, the day      before  Christmas  Eve  2015.  By  then  you  were  17  years  old.  By  arrangement  you  stayed the night at his home. The telephone evidence suggests that you were there for  12 hours or so. I cannot accept that you  had forgotten when you gave  evidence that  you had spent the night at his cottage, whatever intimacy took place between you on   that occasion.  7. By December 2015 you had become involved with drugs. You were not only using   cannabis  and  diazepam  yourself  but  also  selling  those  drugs.  Your  parents  were concerned that you might be doing so. They did their best to help you by urging you  to get rid of the drugs and sort yourself out. Your mother told you that if you were in debt and needed money to get out of the problems you were in, she would provide it. You  rejected  that  sensible  advice  and  chose  instead  to  carry  on  with  your  drug      2 dealing.  It  is  quite  apparent  from  the  text  messages  the  jury  saw  that  in  the  days  leading  up  to  the  killing  you  were  under  considerable  pressure  from  your  own  supplier  to  pay  what  you  owed.  You  were  a  small  time  dealer  in  cannabis  and  diazepam, but with some commercial motivation and not simply to finance your own  habit.  8.  By  5pm  on  Tuesday  23rd  February  you  had  committed  yourself  to  paying  your   supplier  £400  by  Friday.  You  did  not  have  £400,  or  any  immediate  prospect  of   raising it. Within the hour you were in contact with Paul Jefferies asking to meet up   with him that night. It is quite clear that you were making the running. You saw it as  an  opportunity  to  persuade  Paul  Jefferies  to  provide  you  with  the  money  you  desperately  needed.  You  fully  expected  when  Paul  Jefferies  picked  you  up  and  took  you back to his cottage that there would be consensual sex of some kind between the     two  of  you  that  night.  You  were  quite  willing  to  go  along  with  that.  Before  you  met    him  that  night  you  had  taken  drugs,  diazepam  and  cannabis.  You  told  the psychologist  you  had  smoked  more  cannabis  than  usual.  I  have  no  doubt  that  this accounts in part at least for what followed.   9. Only you know precisely what happened in the cottage in the hour and a half or so   you  were  there.  You  have  never  told  the  whole  truth  about  what  happened.  You   appeared  to  remember  far  more  when  you  told  your  mother  about  it  a  few  days  afterwards than you claimed to be able to remember when you gave your evidence to the jury. I accept that there was some sexual activity between the two of you, probably   over a period of an hour or more. You both ended up naked upstairs on the bed. As  you  admitted  in  evidence,  you  did  not  tell  Paul  Jefferies  that  you  did  not  want   penetrative  sex.  There  was no injury or reddening to his  penis indicative of forceful  sex, although that does not preclude it. I am sceptical whether he did penetrate you,   not least because I find it difficult to believe that there would not have been at least  some discussion beforehand about the use of condoms. You have mentioned no such  conversation,  nor  is  there  any  evidence  that  a  condom  was  used.  Your  DNA  was found on his penis, so there was clearly some sexual contact. If there was penetration,   it was only after it began that you told him to stop, even on your own account. You    were  able  to  remove  yourself  physically  from  any  threat  or  danger  by  making  the        excuse that you needed the toilet.     10. If you were intending immediately to leave the cottage, expecting to be able to let yourself  out  of  the  front  door  and  thereby  escape  from  a  dangerous  situation,  it  is      3 strange  that  you  went  downstairs  only  in  your  boxer  shorts.  You  say  that  you panicked on discovering that the door was locked and you could not find the key. You  say  you  picked  up  a  small  knife  in  the  kitchen  and  took  it  upstairs  with  you  in  case you  needed  to  ward  off  further  unwanted  sexual  advances.  You  told  the  jury  in  evidence that when you got back upstairs Paul Jefferies was lying on  the bed facing  the other way. He turned towards you. You said nothing; he said nothing. You then    stabbed  him  as  he  lay  there,  you  thought  only  once.  That  account  can  only  be  a  fraction of the truth. The reality is that you must have stabbed him many times in the bedroom, in an outburst of extreme violence, as the photographs clearly demonstrate. Precisely  what  triggered  that  outburst  we  shall  never  know  unless  and  until  you  choose  to  disclose  it.  It  may  have  been  to  do  with  sex.  It  may  have  been  to  do  with    money.  11.  Paul  Jefferies  came  downstairs  naked  and  bleeding.  There  was  further  extreme violence  in  the  corner  of  the  sitting  room.  He  must  have  picked  up  the  telephone  handset to call for help because it was found, stained with his blood, on the floor in the  opposite  corner  of  the  room.  Close  by  there  were  two  bloodstains  on  the  wall  consistent with his bloodied head being struck against the wall. You accept that you  struck  him  over  the  head  with  an  object.  In  all  likelihood  that  was  the  candlestick  which was found broken into three pieces, bearing traces of his skin and blood.     12. But it was in the kitchen that the final merciless carnage took place. You slashed  his throat at least twice with a bread knife, leaving the marks of the serrations visible on  the  skin.  He  must  have  been  quite  helpless  and  defenceless  by  then,  and  in  all likelihood  you  inflicted  those  injuries  from  behind,  drawing  the  knife  across  his   throat  so  that  his  windpipe  and  jugular  vein  were  completely  severed.  Quite   separately you stabbed him at least five times in the neck, contributing to the gaping   wound which caused his death. You must have used another sharper knife to inflict those  stab  wounds  because  the  bread  knife  was  blunt  nosed  and  would  have  left  a    different  pattern  around  the  entry  wounds.  There  were  similar  slash  wounds  to  the  back of his neck, but not so deep. Although the jury were spared them I have seen the     photographs of the horrific fatal injuries. 13.The  massive  loss  of  blood  from  the  wounds  to  his  neck  would  immediately  have  reduced the blood pressure in his body. I accept the logic of the pathologist’s opinion  that the other two deep stab wounds to Paul Jefferies’ body, to his left loin and to his right  upper  chest,  must  have  been  inflicted  at  a  later  stage,  after  that  fall  in  blood      4 pressure. That is the only explanation for the comparative lack of bleeding from those very  serious  wounds,  each  of  which  could  otherwise  have  been  fatal  in  itself.  One  penetrated the spleen and the kidney. The other passed between the ribs and into the  lung.  The  dimensions  of  those  wounds  mean  that  only  the  small  knife  found  in  the  bedroom  could  have  caused  them.  That  drives  me  to  the  conclusion  that  you  must     have inflicted those wounds at the end, in the kitchen, and you must have discarded  the small knife in the bedroom afterwards when you went upstairs to put on the rest  of your clothes before leaving the house.  14. You had a deep wound at the base of your right thumb which severed the tendons.  You  have  never  suggested  that  Paul  Jefferies  had  a  knife  in  his  hand  at  any  stage,  indeed  he  had  several  defensive  injuries  including  a  wound  which  completely  penetrated  his  left  arm.  I  therefore  conclude  that  you  got  that  injury  to  your  own   hand  from  the  force  of  your  use  of  the  knife  in  stabbing  him  repeatedly.  Given  the ferocity of the attack, it is hardly surprising that when the knife struck bone or some   other  obstruction  your  hand  would  have  slipped  from  the  handle  down  onto  the blade.  You  bled  heavily  from  that  injury  to  your  hand,  but  it  may  well  be  that  the      drips of your blood on the bedding got there only when you went back upstairs and  picked up your clothes from the floor nearby to get dressed.  15. In  total  you inflicted in excess  of 40  knife  wounds  to the head and body of Paul Jefferies,  with  at  least  three  knives.  They  included  stab  wounds  to  his  face,  close  to  the  right  eye,  and  to  his  forehead,  where  the  knife  scored  the  skull.  In  addition  you  inflicted  many blunt force injuries  to his  skull  with the candlestick  and possibly the sharpening steel, which resulted in multiple lacerations. The overall attack must have lasted  several  minutes,  during  which  time  he  was  conscious  and  mobile.  You  must have realised by the end that he was fatally injured. You placed a tea towel over his head and shoulder as he lay dying on the floor, probably because you could not bear  to look at what you had done. 16.  Despite  that,  you  were  sufficiently  composed  to  get  dressed,  find  his  house  and  car keys, unlock the front door and let yourself out. You locked the door behind you.  You  drove  off  in  his  Audi  TT,  an  automatic,  although  you  had  never  driven  an    automatic  car  before  and  were  still  only  a  learner  driver.  Within  minutes  of  leaving  the  house  you  were  on  your  mobile  phone  to  friends.  You  drove  several  miles  to  Crowborough  where  you  picked  them  up  and  they  persuaded  you  to  let  them  drive  you to hospital in Eastbourne because you needed medical attention for your injuries.      5 At  the  hospital  you  had  to  come  up  with  an  explanation  for  your  injuries  and   pretended  that  they  were  caused  by  self-harming.  It  was  when  you  were  in  your hospital  bed  that  your  girlfriend  took  the  “selfie”  photograph  in  which  you  were   making an obscene gesture, and this less than three hours after you had killed a man. 17.  Within  hours  of  being  discharged  from  hospital  two  days  later  you  had  the effrontery to travel back to the vicinity of the murder in the dead man’s car with your  friends, intending to retrieve the coat you had left behind. You left the scene hastily when you saw police activity at the cottage, the body having been discovered earlier  that evening. Next day you told your father about your drug debt and the trouble you  had got into, and your father provided the money to pay off the debt. 18.  You  had  already  disclosed  to  your  mother  some  patchy  details  of  what  had  occurred. She continued to press you next day for a proper account of how you had  come  by  your  injuries,  and  bit  by  bit  part  of  the  truth  emerged,  but  only  part.  On  discovering to their horror that what you were saying tied in with news reporting of a  murder in Mayfield, your parents very properly insisted that you go to the police and   hand yourself in. On the Saturday your mother took you to the police station. In your   interviews  you  provided  a  prepared  statement  but  gave  no  account  of  the  extent  of   the  injuries  and  how  they  were  inflicted  save  for  the  bland  admission  that  “in  an   attempt to obtain keys and escape I caused Paul injury”. 19.  For  the  purposes  of  the  trial  there  was  a  thorough  investigation  by  psychiatrists  and a psychologist of your mental state, to see whether any psychiatric defence might  be available. There was none. I have considered the content of all three reports. They  provide  no  explanation  or  excuse  for  your  actions  that  night  in  murdering  Paul   Jefferies. I note with concern, however, that you told the psychologist you did not feel  sorry for Paul Jefferies although you regretted what you had done. I have detected no  real remorse in your demeanour during the trial, whether in the witness box or in the   dock. 20. I turn to the provisions of schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 which sets out  the  approach  I  must  follow  in  deciding  what  minimum  term  you  must  serve. Because  you  were  under  18  years  of  age  when  you  committed  this  murder  the  prescribed  starting  point  is  12  years.  That  is  the  starting  point  for  any  murder  committed  by  someone  under  18,  however  serious.  But  although  12  years  is  the  starting point, it is not necessarily the finishing point. I have to consider and balance      6 all  the  aggravating  and  mitigating  factors,  including  those  specifically  set  out  in  the schedule. I must also have regard to what the sentence might have been had you been   over 18 at the time. 21.  There  is  one  statutory  aggravating  factor,  by  reference  to  paragraph  10  of  the schedule,  namely  the  mental  or  physical  suffering  inflicted  on  the  victim  before death.  For  the  reasons  I  have  already  explained,  I  am  quite  satisfied  that  you  subjected  Paul  Jefferies  to  a  prolonged  and  sustained  attack  involving  extreme violence,  which  took  place  in  three  separate  rooms,  upstairs  and  downstairs  in  the cottage.  Even  in  the  kitchen  it  is  apparent  that  he  had  been  moving  around  whilst  bleeding.  He  must  have  endured  unimaginable  suffering,  both physical  and  mental,  during  those  tortured  last  few  minutes  of  his  life.  I  regard  that  as  a  gravely  aggravating factor.  22. That goes hand in hand with the more general aggravating factor that this was an  attack involving the use of at least three knives as well as another blunt object. You  had not gone to the cottage armed with a knife. Had you done so, and had you killed him with that knife, the starting point for an adult would have been a minimum term   of 25 years. However, you picked up a knife downstairs in the kitchen which you took   upstairs and used in the bedroom at the start of the attack. On your own admission  he said and did nothing immediately before you started to stab him which could even   begin to excuse or explain that outburst of violence. If your grievance was the way in   which he had treated you sexually a few minutes earlier, your actions in returning to  the bedroom and beginning to stab him were far more in keeping with a considered   desire for revenge. I have no doubt that your behaviour was fuelled by the drugs you had taken before you went to the cottage, cannabis and diazepam. Whilst there was  not  a  significant  degree  of  planning  or  premeditation,  amounting  to  an  aggravating  factor under paragraph 10, this was not a spontaneous reaction to events which had  upset you. 23.  It is an aggravating factor that you left Paul Jefferies bleeding and dying on the  floor  of  his  own  home  and  did  nothing  to  summon  help  for  him.  Instead  your thoughts were only for yourself. You took his car and you and your friends kept that car,  so  that  two  days  later  you  returned  to  the  scene  in  that  car  quite  prepared  to  enter the house and retrieve the coat which you had left behind. No doubt you feared  that it would lead the police to you if they found it first.        7 24. Had I been satisfied that you killed Paul Jefferies in the course of attempting to  rob  him,  the  starting  point  would  be  much  higher,  because  it  would  have  been  a  murder  done  for  gain.  However,  there  is  simply  no  evidence  that  you  stole  or  attempted to steal any money from him that night. Wallets, phones, i-pads and other  valuable  property  were  left  untouched.  You  undoubtedly  went  to  the  house  only  in  order to persuade him to give you money. It was not because you wanted to have sex    with  him,  although  you  knew  that  was  bound  to  happen.  Whilst  that  financial motivation for visiting the house does not aggravate the killing itself, it is part of the  circumstances  which  deprive  you  of  mitigation  which  might  otherwise  have  been available. 25.  I  turn  to  the  mitigating  factors.  By  reference  to  paragraph  11  of  the  schedule,  I accept  that  there  was  no  significant  premeditation  of  the  killing  itself,  but  for  the reasons I have already explained you made a considered decision to go back upstairs  with the knife. That dilutes the force of any mitigation of lack of premeditation. 26.  Under  the  schedule  the  fact  that  the  offender  was  provoked  in  a  way  not amounting to a defence of provocation can be a mitigating factor. The reference to a   defence of provocation must now, of course, be read as a reference to the defence of  loss of control. For the reasons I have already explained, I accept that there was some  sexual  activity  between  you  and  Paul  Jefferies  on  the  bed  which  may  have  involved   the  early  stages  of  penetrative  anal  sex.  But  even  your  own  description  of  how  that ended so easily and so quickly leads me to conclude that there is very little weight I   can  attach to this as a  mitigating factor. You had initiated  the meeting that  evening  knowing full well that sexual activity of that kind could be expected. You cannot have  been  surprised  when  it  happened.  The  jury  heard  that  in  recent  weeks  you  had  frequently searched on the internet for gay and straight pornography, with a focus on   anal sexual intercourse.  27. The  only  other  mitigating  factor  under  the  schedule  is  your  age.  You  were  only   17½  at  the  time  of  the  offence.  That  is  already  reflected,  of  course,  in  the  starting  point of 12 years not 15. 28.  You  have  the  general  mitigation  of  previous  good  character  in  the  sense  of  an absence  of  convictions.  I  ignore  for  present  purposes  your  cautions  for  theft  and assault. But the mitigation of your good character is offset by the criminality of your       8 drug dealing, which is what led directly to the fatal events. I accept that you were still  coming to terms with your own sexuality, and sexual identity. 29. It  is  to  your  credit  that  you  handed  yourself  in  to  the  police,  at  your  mother’s       prompting. That simplified the police investigation. You have never denied the killing  itself, nor could you have denied it.  30.  I  am  all  too  conscious  that  your  parents  are  also  victims  of  your  offending.  You  have had the advantage of being brought up in a loving and supportive family. Your parents  have  conducted  themselves  with  great  dignity  throughout  the  trial.  Your  mother  gave  evidence  for  the  prosecution  of  the  conversations  which  she  had  with  you in the aftermath of the killing. That must have been a dreadful ordeal. You have  to live with the consequences that your actions have had and will continue to have for your parents, as well as for yourself.  31.  Because  of  your  age,  I  am  required  by  the  decided  cases,  and  as  a  matter  of   principle,  to  have  regard  to  the  level  of  your  maturity  or  otherwise,  as  well  as  your        chronological age. There are indications in the psychiatric and psychological reports  of some immaturity. But that has to be balanced against the sophistication of the way  in  which  you  were  running  your  own  small  business  as  a  drug  supplier,  and  the calculated way in which you conducted yourself after you left the house on the night   of the killing and in the days which followed.  32.  Had  you  been  five  months  older  at  the  time  of  the  offence,  and  aged  18,  the  starting  point  would  have  been  15  years  not  12  years.  There  has  to  be  a  significant  increase  from  the  starting  point  of  12  years  to  reflect  the  aggravating  factors  I  have  mentioned.  In  my  judgment  the  aggravating  factors  in  your  case  outweigh considerably the mitigating factors. Balancing all those factors, my conclusion is that  the minimum period you must serve in custody, including the time already served on  remand, is 16 years. That is equivalent to a determinate sentence of 32 years.  33. Stand up please.  Ben Bamford, for this offence of murder you will be detained at   Her Majesty’s Pleasure. That is the same as a sentence of life imprisonment. You will serve a minimum of 16 years, less the 268 days you have spent on remand. Thereafter  it  will  be  for  the  Parole  Board  to  decide  whether  and  if  so  when  you  should  be  released. If and when you are released you will remain on licence for the rest of your  life.       9   10
