  1. 2.  Carly Harris In the Crown Court at Newport 17 December 2018 Sentencing Remarks of The Honourable Mr Justice Picken Carly  Harris,  the  jury’s  verdict  is  that  you  are  Not  Guilty  of  Murder  by  Reason  of Insanity. I must now deal with you in the light of that verdict. This case is a desperately sad one. It sees you standing where you are as a result of your having  killed  your  4-year  old  daughter,  Amelia,  on  8  June  this  year  at  the  house  in Brithweunydd  Road  in  Trealaw,  Tonypandy  which  you  shared  with  her  and  your  two sons.  3. At about 9.15 pm that day, a neighbour of yours, Megan Griffiths, heard what sounded like  a  little  girl  screaming  “Mammy!  Mammy!  Mammy!”.  The  voice  sounded  panicked.  A short while later, Megan Griffiths’s boyfriend, Jake Barlow, heard your 17-year old son, Levi,  screaming  at  you  outside  and  asking  you  “How  could  you.  She’s  my  only  little  sister!”. Angela  Griffiths,  Megan  Griffiths’s  mother,  went  outside  into  the  street  where  your other  son,  Jayden,  aged  just  10,  ran  up  to  her  with  arms  outstretched.  Hugging  Mrs. Griffiths,  he  told  her  “Amelia  is  dead,  will  my  Mammy  go  to  prison?”.  Jayden  was  shaking R -v-  1   8. 9. uncontrollably.  Levi  was  also  in  the  street,  running  around  shouting  “You’ve  killed  her, You’ve killed her” and retching as if to be sick.  4. You were seen by Mrs Griffiths to be standing at the top of a set of steps outside your house.  Mrs  Griffiths  asked  you  what  was  going  on.  You  replied  saying  words  to  the effect of “God will be with her, the Angels have taken her”. You appeared to be dazed. 5. Mrs Griffiths made a 999 call. She was asked by the operator to enter your property in order to see what had happened. As Mrs Griffiths began to do that, Levi told her “She’s out the fucking garden, she’s burnt her”. Mrs Griffiths and a friend, Lisa Evans, then went into the  garden  where  they  saw  a  coffee  table  with  a  square  base.  Amelia’s  dead  body  was lying  on  the  table  covered  with  a  blanket.  She  looked  black,  her  body  was  still smouldering and they could smell the burning body. 6. Shortly  after  that,  on  being  arrested  by  the  police  on  suspicion  of  murder,  you  stated “Jesus told me to do it”. Whilst sat in the back of the police van, you told the police that “she will be okay, trust me, I’m not crazy, I promise you” and made references to the “Angels” and “Jesus”, telling the police “I promise you, Jesus is coming soon”. Asked by one of the officers what had happened, you replied “I promise you I wouldn’t do that to my only girl if she wasn’t returning”.  7. You were then  taken  to Merthyr Tydfil  Police  Station.  There, in the custody  suite, you said “I deserve to die”, “What the fuck my little girl”, “I must be possessed”, “They told me to” and “The Angels said it’s got to be done”.  The next day and the day after that, you were interviewed by the police. You described having visions of angels during the course of those interviews.  These facts speak for themselves. They need no elaboration. A young girl rich in promise met her death at the hands of her mother – and in the most horrific manner. 10. I have heard the medical evidence which has been given in court by Dr Arden Tomison, who has been instructed on your behalf and who  is approved by the Secretary of State under s. 12(2) of the Mental Health Act 1983. I have also read the  reports  which have been prepared by Dr Tomison and by Dr Philip Joseph who has been instructed by the prosecution. 11. I am satisfied that you are suffering from a mental disorder, namely schizophrenia, and that this disorder is of a nature which makes it appropriate for you to be detained in a 2   hospital for medical treatment. I am satisfied also that appropriate medical treatment is available for you at the Cygnet Hospital in Stevenage, whilst noting that the intention is that as soon as possible you will be transferred, administratively, to a more local clinic.  12. I am required under s. 5(3) of the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964 to make what is called a Hospital Order under s. 37 of the Mental Health Act 1983 with a Restriction Order under s. 41 of the 1983 Act. This is because a “special verdict” has been returned for the purposes of s. 5(1)(a) and that “special verdict” is in respect of “an offence the sentence for which is fixed by law” (namely Murder) for the purposes of s. 5(3)(a) – there being no issue that the Court has the power to make a Hospital Order (see s. 5(3)(b)).  13. In  any  event,  I  am  of  the  opinion  that,  because  of  all  the  circumstances  of  your  case, including the nature of the offence (namely Murder) of which you have been found Not Guilty  by  Reason  of  Insanity  and  your  character  which  includes  a  history  of  mental illness, the most suitable method of dealing with your case is by making an order under s. 37  of  the  1983  Act.  I  am  also  satisfied  that  it  is  necessary  to  protect  the  public  from serious harm and that it is not possible to say for how long that will be so, and so that it is appropriate to order that you will be subject to the special restrictions set out in s. 41 of the 1983 Act without limit of time.  [Stand up, please] 14. I, therefore, make a Hospital Order under s. 37 of the 1983 Act ordering that you will be re-admitted to and detained at the Cygnet Hospital in Stevenage where you have been for the past several months.  15. I am satisfied that arrangements have been made for you to be re-admitted right way and, in any event, within 28 days to this hospital.  16. I  also  make  a  Restriction  Order  under  s.  41  of  the  1983  Act  ordering  that  you  will  be subject to the special restrictions set out in s. 41 without limit of time.  3
