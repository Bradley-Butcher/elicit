SOUTHWARK CROWN COURT   REGINA  -V­SCOTT CRAWLEY  DALE WALKER  DANIEL FORSYTH  AARON PETROU  and  BRENDON DALEY    RULING ON ABUSE / ADJOURNMENT   GENERAL  1.	 The defendants are charged with offences of conspiracy to defraud, possessing  criminal  property  and  offences  contrary  to  s.19  and  23(1),  and  s.177(4)(a)  of     the  Financial  Services  and  Markets  Act  2000.  The  evidence  is  complex  and          substantial.  The volume of papers amounts to some 46,030 pages.  There are in      addition  194  excel  spreadsheets  with  a  combined  total  of  864,200  lines  of entry.  The Case Summary covers 55 pages.      2.	 In essence the Crown alleges that between 2008 and 2011 the defendants were    involved  in  a  land  banking scheme  using,  variously,  three  limited  companies.       Those  companies  acquired,  or  purported  to  acquire,  sites  which  were  then     divided into a number of sub-plots.  It is alleged that those sub-plots were then    aggressively marketed to members of the public – often vulnerable members of   the public – who were persuaded to buy based on false representations as to the    nature  of  the  company  selling  the  sub-plots,  the  professionals  they  employed,   as  to  planning  permission,  potential  purchasers  of  the  sites  for  onward   development  and  their  previous  success.  Some  purchasers  were  given  good       title,  some  were  not,  and  some  sub-plots  were  sold  more  than  once.  Various           interventions by the FSA (as it then was) to stop the practices were subverted   by transferring the fraudulent scheme to a new company.   1      3.	 The  rôles  of  the  defendants  range  from  the  directing  minds  of  the  fraud      (Crawley  and  Daley),  the  senior  managers  (Forsyth,  Peters  and  Petrou),  the     salesmen  (Mitchie  and  Hawkins)  to  the  conveyancing  solicitor  (Walker).    There is to be a cutthroat defence run as between Crawley and Walker and it is   likely that other defendants will seek to blame co-defendants.      BACKGROUND  4.	 On 10th  July 2013 the Honorary Recorder of Southwark granted representation       orders for QC and junior to Crawley and Daley, and leading junior and junior    to Forsyth and Petrou.  Walker’s legal team  was privately instructed but he is    now on legal  aid and  his application for extended representation  has not  been  lodged.  On 22nd  July the Legal Aid Authority (“LAA”) notified the parties that               the case has been classified as a Very High Cost Case (“VHCC”).    5.	 In  about  September  2013  the  Ministry  of  Justice  (“MoJ”)  announced  their  intention  to  cut  fees  paid  to  counsel  by  30%.  The  Bar  announced  their     dissatisfaction  with  this  decision  and  their  intention  to  undeem  VHCC  cases.      The  Bar  Standards  Board  was  involved  in  this  and  the  Code  of  Conduct  was  amended to undeem such work.    6.	  Sensing that a number of cases might be affected, the MoJ allowed the previous rates to be extended to any trial which was due to start before 31st  March 2014.   In  all  other  cases  the  Bar  were  given  until  2nd  December  2013  to  decide     whether to accept a VHCC contract on the new terms.  In this and every other     case  which  did  not  fall  within  the  concession  provided  by  the  MoJ  they      declined to accept instructions.   7.	 At  a  hearing  on  14th  November  2013  the  defence  raised  concerns  that  they    would not have counsel for the trial and that there was insufficient time for any   counsel who might now be instructed to be ready by April 2014.  I judged it to        2  be too early to decide that a trial could not be heard in April 2014 and refused        the application to vacate the trial date.   8.	  9.	 By 27th  November 2013 all counsel had returned their briefs.   The case was listed on 23rd  December for the abuse argument to be heard.  The    defence were not united in their approach.  Mr Nicholas Brett, solicitor acting  for  Crawley,  wrote  on  18th  December  submitting that  it  was  too  early  to  hear           Mr  Lee  Adams,  acting  on  behalf  of  Forsyth  in  the  first  trial  and  all  three    defendants in the second trial, who was applying to stay the proceedings.  Mr     Brett submitted that it would not be in the interests of justice to adjourn the trial to accommodate this dispute (see §17 of his statement dated 7th  April 2014 and    pp.23-5 of NMB/1).  The Crown also submitted that the abuse argument should     be adjourned to, at the latest, the first day of trial, and I adjourned the argument  which was then fixed for 28th April 2014.             10.	  At  the  hearing  on  23rd  December  Robin  Heard  of  the  LAA  offered  to  de­    classify the case.  I am told that counsel considered whether to take advantage       of  the  offer  and  thereby  accept  the  rates  available  under  the  Graduated  Fee   Scheme.  Because  counsel  would  not  have  been  able  to  obtain  interim      payments  and  because  any  special  preparation  claim  to  allow  for  reading  papers  exceeding  10,000  pages  would  only  be  resolved  ex  post  facto  with  no      guarantee  that  they  would  be  paid  for  that  additional  reading  (see  Shaffron     07/04/14 Stt. §6), the offer was rejected by all counsel.  At §24 of his statement        Mr Adams supports the  view that counsel would be worse off if the  case was    de-classified.  11.	  During this same period  the MoJ and the Bar  were negotiating over  proposed     reductions  in  graduated  fees.  The  Public  Defender  Service  (“PDS”),  a      department of the LAA, began actively to recruit a pool of employed advocates         to  take  on  work  that  might  otherwise  have  been  done  by  independent   advocates.   3   12.	  On 22nd  January 2014 the solicitors acting for the defendants contacted the PDS and provided details of the case.  The PDS responded on 23rd  January that they            had three QC’s and no juniors employed by the Service.  13.	  On  17th  January  2014  I  formally  ruled  that  there  was  to  be  severance,      irrespective of whether the defendants were  going to be represented.  I judged       that due to the size and complexity of the case, and the number of defendants to   be  tried,  no  jury  could  properly  consider  the  individual  cases  of  eight    defendants in one trial and that there was a real risk that the length of the trial    would  exceed  three  months  and  place  an  intolerable  strain  on  the  jury  were   they to be tried together.     14.	    I ordered that Defence Case Statements, witness requirements, admissions etc.  should be served, and for skeleton arguments  on abuse to be prepared.  It was agreed that no jury would be needed before 6th May 2014.           15.	  On  24th  January  the  Crown  identified  the  defendants  to  be  tried  in  each  trial,  their decision being adopted by the court. The first trial remained fixed for 28th         April  2014  with  a  time  estimate  of  2½  to  3  months  and  the  second  trial  was fixed for 15th  January 2015 with a time estimate of 6 to 8 weeks.        16.	  One of the reasons for requiring the defence to continue to prepare for trial was          to try to ensure that, should I be persuaded that the trial could go ahead with the   defendants unrepresented, or should advocates become available at a late stage    and some further reading time was required, then the trial could start in May, or    after a short delay but within the same time frame.     17.	 I  am  grateful  to  the  solicitors  in  this  case  for  the  work  they  have  done  to     prepare  for  trial  and  I  judge  that,  with  perhaps  the  need  for  some  pre-trial    management which would occupy a few days, this case is trial ready.     4  THE ABUSE ARGUMENT 28TH APRIL 2014     18.	 I  ordered  and  have  been  provided  with  a  joint  skeleton  argument  drafted  on   behalf  of  all  the  defendants  and  have  had  a  separate  written  submission  and heard  from  Mr  Adams,  a  solicitor  with  rights  of  audience,  but  with  no    experience of trial advocacy.  19.	  Mr Alex Cameron QC has appeared bro bono in these proceedings to advance   the  argument  on  behalf  of  the  defendants  that  I  should  stay  the  proceedings    because they are unrepresented through no fault of their own and that I should      not grant an adjournment because the possibility that at some unknown date in   the future an adequately funded advocate may become available is no basis on      which to grant an adjournment.   20.	 The  prosecution  has  been  represented  by  Mr  Ben  Emmerson  QC,  Mr  Sean     Larkin QC, Mr Paul Raudnitz and Ms Polly Dyer.  Mr Emmerson QC has been      instructed by the FCA specifically to deal with legal issues arising in the course     of these submissions and is not instructed as trial counsel.    21.	 The  Crown  accepts  that  involuntary  lack  of  representation  would  be   inconsistent with the European Convention on Human Rights and common law  rights  and  they  accept  that  a  fair  trial  cannot  be  held  now.  It  is  the  Crown’s    submission that there is a reasonable prospect  that advocates will be available   to represent the defendants in the future and that I should adjourn the trial to a       future  date  rather  than  staying  the  indictment.  I  have  also  considered  their   latest note on choice of representation which was served on 30th  April.          22.	  Mr  Tom  Little,  who  appeared  as  Amicus  Curiae  instructed  by  the  Attorney        General  to  assist  the  court  has  helpfully  pointed  out  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  in  the  arguments  put  forward  by  the  Crown  and  the  defence.  He    points to a stay as an abuse of the process being an exceptional remedy and to        the need for me to consider whether an adjournment is likely to bring about an   effective trial in the future.   5   23.	 It  is  agreed  by  both  sides  that  my  ruling only  affects  the  five  defendants  who   are listed for trial this week.   24.	  At  previous  hearings  the  solicitors  representing  the  interests  of  their  clients       have  been  keen  to  stress  that  they  do  not  want  their  clients  to  become  the     victims of a dispute between the Bar and the Government.  I agree with them.       25.	 Similarly my decision on how to proceed in this case is taken without regard to  the continuing dispute between the Bar and the MoJ.  I am only concerned with         the merits of the arguments put before me and to ensure that a trial is only held   if it can be conducted fairly in accordance with the principles long established   in  this  country  and  which  are,  additionally,  enshrined  in  Article  6  of  the      European Convention on Human Rights.    FIRST ISSUE: CAN THE DEFENDANTS RECEIVE A FAIR TRIAL NOW?    26.	  Having been invited by Mr Larkin QC to strike out the last six lines of §15 of     the Prosecution’s First Skeleton Argument, for the purposes of this application   the  prosecution  accept  that  the  defence  took  reasonable  steps  to  find     representation  up  to  mid  January  2014,  that,  presumably,  being  the  time  by       which advocates would have needed to be instructed for the trial to take place   in April.  It follows that I should approach this argument on the basis that the    defendants  have  not  voluntarily  or  by  their  own  indolence  failed  to  obtain representation.   27.	 The  efforts  to  find  representation  included  contact  with  70  sets  of  chambers  with barristers who hold themselves out as competent to undertake this sort of  work in and outside London.     28.	  By 15th  January 2014 there was one silk who put himself forward as willing to      accept instructions.  He withdrew on 16th  January.      6   29.	 It  is  beyond  question  that  the  PDS  is  not  in  a  position  to  provide  sufficient          representation  for  a  trial  beginning  in  April  2014.  Other  avenues  were     explored which I will summarise later in this ruling.   30.	  Mr  Emmerson  QC  and  Mr  Larkin  QC,  have  in  written  and  oral  submissions    accepted that, where through no fault of the defendants they are unrepresented,       to  try  them  would  be  in  breach  of  their  common  law  rights  and  in  addition      contrary to Article 6(3) of the Convention.   31.	 It follows that there is common ground in respect of the First Issue: the case is   ready for trial and the court has set aside the necessary time to hear this case.   However  none  of  the  five  defendants  can  receive  a  fair  trial  unrepresented.  It    follows that none of the five defendants can be tried now.   32.	 That  is  not  an  end  to  the  matter.  At  the  hearing  on  23rd  December  2013  I       included the following passage in my ruling:      “I cannot  rule  at  this  stage  that  it  would  be  an  abuse  of  the  process  of  this court to try the defendants in four months time, nor do I know now  whether in four months time an adjournment of an unknown amount of time may not cure the problem that the defendants now face…           “I add… that, should any defendant fail to exploit the opportunity to get  representation,  I  judge  that  to  be  something  I  could  properly  take  into    account if this application to stay has to be made on 28th  April 2014.          Meanwhile I will continue to manage this case for a first trial beginning on 28th  April.”     33.	 The Second  Issue is, therefore, should I grant  an adjournment?  First  I set out       the topics which I have considered in this regard.         7  FURTHER ENQUIRIES UNDERTAKEN TO OBTAIN REPRESENTATION   34.	 The continuing failure to  secure  advocates is  relevant  to  my decision  whether       to grant an adjournment but I do not intend to review the painstaking enquiries       to find advocates which have been undertaken jointly by the solicitors because  it is sufficiently set out in the statements of  Lee Adams,  Ilana Hutton (7th  and  24th  April) and Amy Shaffron (7th, 24th  and 25th  April) and in their exhibits.               35.	 The  process  was  repeated  after  27th  March  2014  when  an  agreement  was    reached between the MoJ and the Bar in relation to the Graduated Fee Scheme  (see  the  Chairman  of  the  Criminal  Bar  Association’s  statement,  ALS/14).      Schedules have been prepared to show the position over time as more and more  chambers confirmed that they had no counsel available and willing to work on      VHCC cases.  The second statement of Ms Shaffron sets out the results of her    latest  attempts  to  find  counsel.  She  has  responses  from  69  chambers  to  the      effect that they are unwilling to accept this case as a VHCC.    36.	  When the prosecution identified a  further 58  sets of chambers who  undertook criminal  work  in  their  skeleton  dated  Sunday  27th  April  2014,  the  defence       immediately began the task of contacting those chambers on the Monday whilst     I  heard  argument.  Of  the  35  that  they  were  able  to  contact,  four  needed  to       check with their members but the other 31 had no one available.    37.	 Enquiries  have  been  made  without  success  with  the  Bar  of  Northern  Ireland   and  the  Faculty  of  Advocates  in  Edinburgh,  including  those  with  dual    qualifications which allow them to appear in courts in England and Wales.    38.	  Whilst the solicitors in this case have been invaluable in the preparation of the      defence  cases  to  the  date  appointed  for  trial,  no  one  suggests  that  any  of  the        firms have Higher Court Advocates (“HCA”) capable of conducting the trial on   behalf of their clients.  However they conducted enquiries with 90 other firms      of solicitors to see whether they could provide HCA’s, and none were willing  to take on the case (see Hutton Stt. §37).      8 39.	  Mr  Larkin  QC  was  critical  of  the  process  undertaken  by  the  defence,   questioning  whether  the  enquiries  addressed  whether  an  advocate  would  be         available  for  April  or  whether  they  would  be  available  at  some  stage  in  the     future to represent a defendant under the VHCC scheme.  He pointed to the fact    that  the  hunt  for  in-house  advocates  had  tended  to  concentrate  on  the  Magic    Circle  firms  rather  than  the  many  smaller  firms  of  solicitors  who  employ  in­     house  advocates.  He  also  points  to  whether  the  Bar’s  resolve  not  to  accept       VHCC work at the present rates may weaken as time passes.     40.	 In my judgement, whilst Mr Larkin QC raises important issues in this respect,    the effort put in by the defence to find trial advocates has been very substantial   indeed and has been unsuccessful.  41.	  Mr  Larkin  QC  also  suggests  that,  if  there  are  insufficient  QC’s  available,  the     representation order could be amended to allow for two juniors or just a junior  acting on his own.  For my part, where a certificate for a QC and junior is only       given in exceptional circumstances and based on factors including the size and   complexity of a case, I can see no reason why the defence should seek to alter          the order.  I remind myself that it is the duty of the State to provide advocates      at  the  required  level  of  competence  and  experience  pursuant  to  the  court’s interpretation of the government’s own legislation.  It is not for the defence to    cut its just entitlement to representation to suit the State.   42.	  Mr  Larkin  QC  suggested  that,  in  order  to  make  the  trial  fair  and  prevent  it    being  stopped  as  an  abuse,  were  the  level  of  representation  to  be  reduced  for       the  defence  then  that  might  result  in  the  prosecution  or  the  judge  using  his  powers  of  trial  management  to  decline,  for  instance,  to  entertain  the    prosecution’s application to adduce bad character.  That is an issue pertinent to     this  case  because  the  prosecution  has  served  a  full  A4  file  of  documents  in  respect of bad character applications.   9   43.	 Such a submission, whilst well intentioned, would result in a perversion of the      trial process;  the better  defended  a defendant  is, the  more likely he  is to  have        his bad character adduced.  The overriding objective of the Criminal Procedure    Rules to deal with criminal trials justly is, therefore, subverted by failure of the    State to provide adequate representation.   44.	 Following the argument to its logical conclusion, and having in mind principles    of equality of arms, if the defence were unable to find the QC’s to which their         Representation  Order  entitles  them,  would  the  Crown  be  invited  to  reduce  its      own  representation  by  removing  Mr  Larkin  QC  from  the  prosecution  team      which  presently  comprises  a  Silk  and  two  juniors?  Criminal  trials  of  this    complexity rely on the skills of highly competent and experienced advocates on  both  sides  to  reduce  issues,  make  matters  understandable  to  a  jury  and  keep       trials to a reasonable length.     THE PUBLIC DEFENCE SERVICE  45.	 The  solicitors  have  been  in  regular  contact  with  the  PDS,  with  Byrne  &     Partners  taking  the  lead  on  behalf  of  all  the  solicitors  involved  in  this  case.      Moving  on  from  initial  problems  obtaining  sufficiently  detailed  CV’s  of  the      QC’s who had joined the service so as to give them and their clients the ability        to  make  an  informed  decision  as  to  choice,  on  4th  February  2014  Mr Marshalsay of the PDS gave the details of an HCA who had joined the service      but seemed to accept that she had insufficient experience to undertake this sort  of case (ILH/13).    46.	  By 7th  February 2014 (ILH/15)  it became  clear that one silk was  immediately        available  to  be  instructed  and  that  a  second  would  be  available  by  the  end  of    February  but  issues  arose  over  Paragraph  7  of  the  original  PDS  Code  of     Conduct  which  did  not  permit  an  employee  to  act  for  a  client  where  to  do  so  would give rise to a conflict of interest including in circumstances where “…a   10  client’s  best  interests  conflicts  with  the  interests  of…another  client  of  the   salaried service…”.  47.	  Although the solicitors were told that the Code was under review, they judged,    because  the  Code  was  binding on  all  parties,  that  where  there  was  a  potential   conflict  between  the  defendants,  it  would  not  be  ethically  proper  to  proceed   until the Code had been amended.  I do not criticise them for that decision.        48.	  By an email dated 20th  February 2014 (ILH/19), the defence for Mr Daley set     out the issues they had with instructing advocates from the PDS:      (a)	 It  had  been  determined  that  the  defendant  should  have  a  silk  and  a  junior and, the PDS could only offer one silk immediately available     and no junior.   (b)	 In  total  they  were  being  offered  the  choice  between  two  silks  from  the entire list of silks who are able to practice in England and Wales.   They would be failing in their professional duty to advise their client,    as a matter of expediency, to accept one or those two silks of whom      they have had no experience and cannot personally vouch for.  They    felt bound to advise their client to wait to see whether the choice will    increase and a junior counsel will become available.   (c)	 The  conflict  of  interest  issue  remained  unresolved.  The  solicitors     discovered  for  themselves  that  the  Code  was  amended  in  March     2014.  Despite  the  amendment  to  the  Code,  the  issue  has  not  gone  away.  In a letter dated 17th  April 2014 (ILH/37) Byrne and Partners      raised  real  practical  issues  in  respect  of  conflict  and  have  asked  for   reassurances as to how matters would be handled by the PDS.  These  have  subsequently  been  addressed  in  a  letter  dated  23rd  April  from      the PDS (ILH/41).    11  49.	  On  20th  March  a  letter  was  sent  from the  LAA  to  all  VHCC  contract  holders         reminding  them  that  they  must  explore  all  possible  avenues  to  find      representation, reinforcing this requirement with the sanction that failure to do   so  would  amount  to  a  fundamental  breach  of  the  contract  which  may  lead  to   termination of the contract and such termination would be considered in respect of any further tender for a VHCC contract.    50.	 That same day the PDS was emailed (ILH/26) and asked what the position as to   recruitment was.  They were told that interviews were taking place at all levels.   By 3rd  April the PDS informed them that they had completed their “…first and            very successful round of recruitment.”  The recruits would be joining over the   “coming weeks”.  Four CV’s were attached and subsequently the solicitors for Mr  Daley  were  told  that  four  counsel  were  available  for  the  trial.  On  21st          March the PDS sent an email to Petrou’s solicitors (ILH/27) which stated that,   having  reviewed  the  position  with  one  of  their  QC’s,  it  was  not  thought  that     there would be sufficient time to prepare.  Counsel would be available to apply    for an adjournment of the trial to allow for preparation.   51.	  Clarification of start dates of employed advocates was provided by the PDS on 17th  April  (ILH/29).  The  defence  were  told  that  both  QC’s  that  were  to  be            available  were  now  unwell.  The  juniors  could  start  with  “near-immediate     effect”.  The  PDS  felt  that  the  advocates  could  assess  how  long  they  would       need  to  prepare  and  support  the  defence  in  putting  this  information  before  a    court. 52.	  On  17th  April  the  PDS provided  an  update  on  availability  (ILH/39)  which  set       out  that  they  had  three  QC’s,  one of  whom was  preparing for  a  14  week trial due to start on 8th  September 2014, one was ill but could take instructions prior           to his return in four weeks and one was unavailable until September.  In May    two senior and one junior advocate would become available, in June a further   QC, five senior and a junior advocate would come into the service and another   senior  advocate  by  July.  There  were  further  conditional  offers  for  two  more            12 senior advocates who may start in May and June and two QC’s who may start in  June  and  July.  The  expected  size  of  the  PDS advocacy  unit  by  the  end  of      July is six QC’s, ten Senior HCA’s and two junior HCA’s.      53.	 I  was  provided  with  a  further  update  during  the  proceedings  by  Ms  Clare       Toogood:   (a)	  No  QC’s  are  available  at  present.  One  will  be  available  in  four  weeks, another from 2nd  July, a third from “later in the summer” but              he is recouping from, I understand it, a serious health problem and he        would need to be spoken to as to when he  may be able to read into the case.  One is due to start a 12 week case in September.  Having in         mind  the  time  required  for  preparation  and  the  burden  of  preparing     and  presenting  a  defence  in  a  complex  fraud,  I  judge  that  two  of    those  silks  are  very  unlikely  to  be  available  to  take  instructions  in       this case.  be available.   (b)	 Two more unnamed QC’s are due to start in June and July and would  (c)	 There is a list of ten other advocates and two further advocates who  are  due  to  join  the  PDS who  will  become  available.  That  list  does      not  distinguish  between  junior  and  senior  advocates.  No  criteria    have  been  drawn  to  my  attention  as  to  how  the  PDS  makes  that    distinction  but  Ms  Toogood  has  stated  that  all  the  senior  advocates  have  led  in  the  past.  Whilst  the  figures  do  not  entirely  coincide  between  the  documents,  making  use  of  an  email  received  on  17th       April  (ILH/42)  from  Mr  Marshalsay,    I  calculate that  the  overwhelming  preponderance  of  the  juniors  employed  by  the  PDS   qualify as leading juniors.    (d)	 There are no plans at present to recruit any more advocates.     13  (e)	  Advocates will be allotted to cases following the “cab rank rule” on a     first come, first served basis.    (f)	 They are employed to work a 37 hour week but would be expected to     work to finish a particular task.      (g)	 The  PDS consider  that,  with  the  revised  Code,  they  can  manage  all     conflicts.  54.	  A number of issues arise in respect of the use of the PDS.  Firstly, the defence        accept that they are required to make use of advocates employed by the PDS if        they  are  available.  Article  6(3)(c)  allows  everyone  charged  with  a  criminal     offence the minimum right:   “to  defend  himself  in  person  or  through  legal  assistance  of  his  own  choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.”       55.	 I  have  been  referred  to  Croissant  v.  Germany  (1993)  16  E.H.R.R.  135  in      respect of the right to a choice of representation where the state pays for legal  assistance.  There  is  a  difference  in  the  emphasis  put  on  this  decision  by  Mr    Emmerson QC  for the  Crown and  Mr Cameron QC as  to the interpretation to    be given to the decision.  56.	 In that case the court appointed Mr Hauser to represent Croissant although the  court  knew  that  he  had  no  confidence  in  Mr  Hauser.  At  §29  the  court  stated      that:        “…not  withstanding  the  importance  of  a  relationship  of  confidence  between  lawyer  and  client,  that  right  [to  counsel  of  his  own  choosing]   cannot be considered to be absolute.  It is necessarily subject to certain  limitations  where  free  legal  aid  is  concerned  and  also  where,  as  in  the  present case, it is for the courts to decide whether the interests of justice   require  that  the  accused  be  defended  by  counsel  appointed  by  them.  When appointing counsel the national courts must certainly have regard   to  the  defendant’s  wishes:  indeed,  German  law  contemplates  such  a              14   course.  However they can override those wishes when there are relevant  and sufficient  grounds  for holding that this is  necessary in the interests  of justice”     57.	 I have reminded myself that in that case the regional Court was of the view that    Mr Hauser provided the best guarantees of an adequate defence and Croissant’s  reasons for rejecting him were not valid.      58.	 The  courts  here  have  taken  a  similar  line:  a  defendant  is  entitled  to  be   represented  by  counsel  of  his  choice  if  that  is  reasonably  practicable.  That,     however, will depend on the availability of counsel but also on the availability     at the same time of a suitably equipped court, of the witnesses and a timescale     appropriate to the case.  The overriding consideration must be the requirements     of  justice  for  the  prosecution  and  the  defence,  see  R.  v.  De  Oliveira  [1997]        Crim. L.R. 600.    59.	  In my judgment the defendants cannot hold out for independent counsel of their     choice  to  become  available  and  Mr  Cameron  QC  does  not  seek to  argue  that.  However, the solicitor acting for a defendant is under a duty to advise his client    on  the  best  counsel  available  to  them  and  is  entitled  to  hold  off  instructing     anyone  until  he  has  the  best  possible  choice  available  to  him,  so  long as  that          delay does not jeopardise the date set for trial and the ability of advocates to be    trial ready by that date.  60.	  Mr  Cameron  QC  has  raised  the  issue  of  the  effect  on  the  available  PDS     employed  advocates  as  a  result  of  the  proposed  adjournment  of  this  trial.    I have ascertained that, were I to  grant an adjournment this trial could be heard on  15th  January  2015  with  the  second  trial  to  follow  on.     If  that  is  not      practicable then the case could not be listed until September 2015.  61.	  He  suggests  that  other  cases  will  become  front  runners  for  the  available  PDS      advocates which will not leave sufficient advocates to prepare for and appear in   a trial in January 2015.      15  62.	 Into  that  equation  I  have  to  consider  how  long  would  be  required  for  a  PDS     advocate to prepare for this trial.  Whilst I can see how the requirement to work     until they finish a particular task might affect  the hours that they work during    trial,  it  would  be unreasonable  to  expect  employed  advocates  to  work beyond      their contracted  hours  week after  week to prepare for a  trial.  The  first  Junior           counsel  for  the  Crown  has  spent  1000  hours  preparing  this  case.  That  is  not      surprising bearing in mind the burden he has of preparing the case in respect of    eight  defendants  and  drafting  a  substantial  volume  of  documentation.  The            Crown has the benefit of a second junior who is instructed in the case and who,      I suspect, is largely, but not exclusively, involved in the disclosure process.      63.	  An  advocate  appearing  for  one  defendant  will  need  substantially  less  time  to      prepare, but it is hard to imagine that it would be less than, say, 450 hours. That      would only allow him an hour to read every 100 pages without consideration of   the 194 spreadsheets.  On the basis of a 37 hour week the advocate will need a       minimum of twelve clear weeks out of court to prepare this case.  It means that    the advocate must be available from early October until trial.    64.	  Mr  Little  suggested  that  there  could  be  merit  in  all  the  current  VHCC  cases      being listed before one judge in order to allocate resources accordingly.  There    are  eight  other  trials  arising  from  six  prosecutions  which  are  due  to  begin      between  September  2014  and  September  2015  and  which  will  require  somewhere in excess of 21 defendants to be represented in addition to the eight      defendants who need to have representation in this case.  Whilst the majority of     the cases are listed at Southwark, there are cases listed at several other courts.    65.	  Whilst Mr Little’s submission had its attractions, apart from the improbability      that  other  courts  on  other  Circuits  would  release  their  cases,  it  would  involve   the nominated judge in decisions which went far outside trial management and  which might involve him in selecting which defendants would have first choice    of  advocate  or  in  making  other  decisions  which  would  involve  the  judge  in    areas which lay outside his remit.   16   66.	 In my judgment whether there are sufficient employed advocates to cover this     case when those same advocates  may be required to prepare for and appear in   other  cases,  is  simply  another  matter  which  I  have  to  take  into  account  when     deciding  whether  I  would,  in  granting  an  adjournment,  be  acting  purely         speculatively as to whether the trial could ever take place.    CONFLICT AND THE USE OF PDS LAWYERS  67.	  Mr  Cameron  QC  and  Mr  Adams  identify  that  there  is  a  conflict  between       Crawley  and  Walker.    I  judge  that  §7.3(b)  of  the  amended  PDS  Code  of    Conduct,  which  sets  out  that  where  conflict  arises  the  PDS  lawyer  must   “explain  that the client  is free  to be  represented by other  legal representatives       outside  the  PDS  Advocacy  Service”,  must  envisage  other  advocates  being    available in independent practice.    68.	  Whilst  I  agree  with  Mr  Little  that  I  should  place  little  value  on  it  for  the      purposes of this argument because it is unknown whether any defendant would     avail  himself  of  that  opportunity  or  would  be  content  to  remain  with  a  PDS lawyer  and  make  use  of the  “enhanced  confidentiality  provisions”  I  nevertheless  have  to  allow  for  the  views  expressed  by  Mr  Adams  that  the  advice he would expect a solicitor to give to his client in such circumstances is     that he should take the option provided by §7.3(b).  I should, therefore have in       mind whether any legal representatives outside of the PDS will be available to       the defendant(s) affected.   THE USE OF COURT TIME AND THE EFFECT OF GRANTING AN ADJOURNMENT  I  have  already  indicated  that  this  court  could  hear  this  trial  on  15th  January.     69.	    The  effect  of  that  would  be  to  push  the  second  trial  back  to  March  2015  or,    allowing the advocates, and perhaps the judge, a short break between trials, to      17     April.  To  accommodate  this  additional  strain  on  the  court’s  resources,  other      cases will have to be delayed.   70.	 It is of note that the figures for trial receipts at this court for the year to March     2014  shows  a  58%  increase  over  last  year.  The  London  Courts  overall  have      seen a 26% increase in trial receipts.  The sitting profile for London, that is the        number  of  court  days  which  each  court  is  allowed  to  sit,  will  continue  to  be    under considerable stress for the foreseeable future.  It follows that it is highly       unlikely  that  the  work  which  would  have  to  be  moved  to  accommodate  this     trial in January will find a home in any of the other London courts.     71.	 It  is  no  wonder  that  §3.2.(2)(f)  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Rules  requires  the  court  in  furthering  the  overriding  objective  which  I  referred  to  earlier,  to       “discourage delay, dealing with as many aspects of the case as possible on the    same occasion and avoiding unnecessary hearings”.  Further, at §3.8 the court         is required at any hearing at which the case cannot be concluded to “there and  then…give directions so that it can be concluded at the next hearing or as soon     as possible after that.”  The relevance of that paragraph to the adjournment of a   trial is emphasised by the first entreaty that follows those words, that is for the   trial judge to decide whether, where a defendant fails to attend, the trial should      continue in his absence.   72.	 It is part of  my responsibility to take into account the effect on other cases of  adjourning  the  hearing  for  which  court  time  has  been  put  aside.       I  remind   myself that finding another three month slot for this case is bound to delay the    trials of other defendants through no fault of their own.     73.	 I  also  remind  myself  that,  in  resisting  severance,  Mr  Larkin  QC  drew  to  my      attention the effect of delay on the second trial.  I did not judge that a delay to       January  2015  was  so  detrimental  as  to  make  that  trial  unfair.  However  if  I     grant  the  adjournment  of  the  first  trial  with  the  second  to  follow,  I  am  now       18  faced with that second trial going back by approximately a year from this April     when it might otherwise have been tried with eight defendants.   74.	  Mr  Larkin  QC  put  forward  during  argument  that,  if  there  are  insufficient     resources to try five defendants together, there should be a trial of an individual   defendant  or  some  defendants  who  have  managed  to  find  an  advocate  and  he    submitted  that  this  is  a  better  solution  than  preventing  the  prosecution  from  being brought at all.  With respect to Mr Larkin QC, his suggestion will result     in a series of up to eight trials, each of some substantial length, clogging up this     court  for  perhaps  a  year  or  more.      It  will  allow  cutthroat  defences  to  go     unanswered and cannot be in the overall interests of justice.    SECOND ISSUE: SHOULD THE PROSECUTION BE GRANTED AN ADJOURNMENT?     75.	 I  am  invited  by  the  prosecution  to  grant  an  adjournment  to  prevent  the  case    being stayed.  No party submits that a temporary stay is available in a criminal       trial; that is simply another way of describing an adjournment.      76.	 The  prosecution  rely  on  Attorney  General’s  Reference  No.  2  of  2001  [2003]      UKHL  68.  I  accept  the  principle  that  a  stay  will  never  be  an  appropriate   remedy  where  a  lesser  remedy  would  adequately  vindicate  the  defendant’s      Convention  rights.     In  the  context  of  this  case  they  argue  that,  if  an        adjournment  to  January  2015  or  even  September  2015  would  allow  for    appropriate  representation  of  the  accused,  then  that  should  be  the  course     adopted rather than to stay the proceedings now.  77.	  However in circumstances where it is accepted that the defendants cannot have     a  fair  trial  now,  in  deciding  whether  an  adjournment  would  adequately    vindicate the defendant’s Convention rights, I have to consider whether there is          a realistic prospect of a fair trial in January or September.  If there is not, then           an adjournment cannot cure the problem that has arisen.   19 78.	  A  “realistic  prospect”  in  these  circumstances  connotes  something  less  than    certainty  but  which  is  a  real  and  practical  prospect  of  the  trial  proceeding  within  a  reasonable  time  frame.  It  must  be  something  more  than  a  fanciful       prospect.  The  Crown  prefers  the  wording  “reasonable  prospect”  but  I  do  not     judge that there is any material difference in meaning between the two phrases.     79.	 In  determining  whether  I  should  grant  an  adjournment  at  all  and  in  deciding   whether  there  is  a  reasonable  prospect  of  this  case  being tried  in  the  future,  I    have considered the following factors:­   (a)	 Failure to grant an adjournment will deprive the victims of crime of   the  opportunity  to  see  those  that  they  judge  responsible  prosecuted.    To deny them that opportunity should not be lightly taken.  Against          that  I  judge  that  there  are  other  methods  available  to  the  victims  to    recover  their  losses  civilly  and  there  are  other  regulatory  offences  which could be brought against the defendants which may not  meet the gravamen of the conduct alleged but which could mark out their    alleged  misconduct and prevent them from being able to take a rôle    in corporate activity in the future.    (b)	  Although  the  FCA  is  answerable  to  HM  Treasury  rather  than  the  Attorney General, it is nevertheless an arm of the State which brings    this  prosecution.   The responsibility to  provide  adequate  representation  at  public  expense  is  also  the  responsibility  of  the    State.    I  have  considered  whether  the  State  should  in  those  circumstances  be  entitled  to  benefit  from  its  own  failure  by  being   granted an adjournment.   (c)	 The State also provides at public expense the court in which the case   is to be tried.  An adjournment of the trial will involve an additional     stress on the State’s provision of resources to try crime.   20  (d)	  Whilst the PDS has provided a pool of available advocates at public   expense, it is so small so that it is insufficient to cover all the VHCC   cases due to be tried unless control of listing these cases becomes no longer a judicial function but one effectively controlled and dictated  by the availability of the PDS advocates.  That would be a dangerous         precedent, see De Oliveira.    (e)	 Bearing in  mind availability and  preparation time required  I am not    satisfied  that  sufficient  PDS  advocates  would  be  available  to  assist    the defendants in this trial.  It is not in the interests of justice to try   each defendant separately.    (f)	 I have no reason to think that there is a realistic prospect that the Bar   will accept contracts in VHCC cases on the present terms.  (g)	  Whilst Article 6(3) does not provide the legally aided defendant with  the right to an advocate of his choice, it still permits the solicitor to    carry out his duty to assess which available advocate would best suit        his client’s case.  A solicitor is entitled to delay that choice until the        moment that he judges the pool from which to choose is at its height.         That may be at any time between now and early October.     CONCLUSION   80.	 I  have  reminded  myself  that  a  stay  should  only  be  granted  in  exceptional   circumstances and that in most cases an adjournment can cure what otherwise    might amount to an abuse of the process of the court.    21  81.	 I  have  taken  into  account  that  it  is  common  ground  between  the  parties  that       where the defendant is not at fault, in a case of this complexity the defendants  could not receive a fair trial without advocates to represent them.   82.	 I  have  considered  The  Crown  Prosecution  Service  v.  Cambell;  McInerney  v.     The  Financial  Services  Authority;  The  Medicines  and  Healthcare  Products Regulatory Agency  v. Carlton [2009] EWCA Crim 997 in which the Court of      Appeal  dealt  with  applications  to  stay  confiscation  proceedings  because  there       was no appropriate representation.  In giving the judgment of the court, Hooper       LJ said:  “We reached the conclusion that the fact that in the future an adequately  funded  advocate  may  be  available  was  no  justification  for  an  adjournment.  The  problem identified  in  this  case  is  not  a  new  one:  see e.g. the decision of HHJ Mole QC reported on BAILII as P [2008] EW  Misc 2 (EWCC). That decision was handed down over a year ago.”          83.	 I agree with Mr Little that I should not read too much into that decision where    the  issues  were  different  from  those  that  I face,  not  least  in  that  I am  dealing     with  a  decision  whether  to  grant  an  adjournment  in  respect  of  a  serious  allegation which is as yet unproven.  However it does provide some support for      the  care  that  I  should  take  before  granting  an  adjournment  where  there  is  no         realistic prospect that in the future a suitable advocate will be available.   84.	  Having considered all these matters I am compelled to conclude that, to allow      the  State  an  adjournment  to  put  right  its  failure  to  provide  the  necessary      resources to permit a fair trial to take place now amounts to a  violation of the           process of this court.     85.	 The knock-on effect on other trials, the waste of court resources and the need to   disregard  the  Criminal  Procedure  Rules  designed  to  protect  the  court  system    from abuse and to ensure that scare resources are used to best effect all, in my        judgment, add to the reasons why an adjournment should not be granted.      22   86.	 Even if I am wrong about that, I further find  that there is no realistic prospect         that sufficient advocates would be available for this case to be tried in January      2015  from  any  of  the  sources  available  to  the  defence,  including  the  PDS.       Whatever  reason  is  put  forward  by  the  party  applying,  the  court  does  not   ordinarily grant adjournments on a speculative basis.    87.	 It  would  be  unconscionable  to  put  this  trial  off  to  September  2015  with  the    second  trial  being heard  in  2016.  On  what  I  now  know,  there  is  no  basis  on          which I could find that the availability of advocates would be any different then   than it will be in January 2015.  In addition it is likely to lead to a violation of       the reasonable time requirement in Article 6(1).    88.	 In those circumstances I stay the proceedings against these five defendants.
