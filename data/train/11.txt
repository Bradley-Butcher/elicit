 R  ‐v‐Nkosiyapha Kunene and Virginia Kunene      In the Central Criminal Court      28 February 2014    Sentencing Remarks by Mr Justice Singh       [The Defendants may remain seated for now.]        Introduction  1.	  This is on any view a tragic case.          2.	  The  Defendants  have  both  pleaded  guilty  to  the  offence  of  gross  negligence              manslaughter. They were the parents of Ndingeko Kunene, who was born on 1              January 2012.  He died on 14 June 2012. He was found to have been suffering                  from florid rickets resulting from severe vitamin D deficiency.          3.	  Although at one point it was not entirely clear, it has become clear as a result of                   discussions that have taken place between the parties during the course of this              sentencing hearing that there are no material disputes of fact.  Those discussions              have led to further written bases of plea being filed by both Defendants today.                The  Crown  opened  the  hearing  on  the  basis  of  its  Case  Summary.  The  facts,                 events  and  dates  set  out  in  that  summary  are  not  disputed  on  behalf  of  the                Defendants, although they have drawn attention to certain other matters in their              1 bases of plea.  Reference should be made to all of those documents for greater                detail.  I hope it will suffice for present purposes if I summarise the facts.                    Factual summary   4.	  From  birth  Ndingeko  had  medical  problems.  On  the  day  he  was  born  he  was                  moved for a day or two to the Special Care Baby Unit because of his low weight                  and  difficulty  in  establishing  breast  feeding.  However,  he  was  discharged  from            hospital on 6 January.  A care plan was put in place for visits by Social Services                  and  community  midwives. Before  he  was discharged,  the  Defendants said  that            they would bring him to hospital if he was unwell.  It is emphasised on behalf of                  the Defendants that Ndingeko’s vitamin D deficiency was not diagnosed at that             stage, nor was Mrs Kunene given advice about taking supplements, which would             have  been  important  in  particular  because  she  was  going  to  breastfeed            exclusively and in view of her ethnic origins and her vegan diet.             5.	  Over the following weeks Ndingeko was visited by health visitors on a number of                occasions.  However, Mrs Kunene did not attend the scheduled 8 week check up               on 8 March and Ndigeko was not seen by a health care professional again before                14 June.   6.	  From April 2012 it was appreciated by the Defendants that their son was unwell.                 However, his health fluctuated over the next two months.  Although he was not               visited by healthcare professionals as such, Mrs Kunene’s sister is a midwife and              did  visit  on  occasion.  On  9  April  she  noted  that  Ndingeko  had  apparently  lost                 weight and his breathing was wheezy.  She and another relative, who is a health                visitor, expressed concerns more than once and asked Mrs Kunene to consult her              2 GP.  She said that she would do so but would speak to her husband first.  It is                      clear that, because of their own religious beliefs, the Defendants did not in fact               seek  medical  assistance,  nor  did  they  seek  advice  for  example  from  the  NHS              Direct helpline.   7.	  Both  Defendants  are  strict  Seventh  Day  Adventists.  However,  their  views  (in               particular Mr Kunene’s) appear to be very extreme and do not reflect the official               doctrine of that church.  On the other hand, it has been emphasised on behalf of                 the  Defendants  and,  in  particular  Mrs  Kunene,  that  they  have  not  refused  all              medical  interventions  at  all  times.  For  example,  a  vitamin  K  injection  was               accepted shortly after the birth although it had initially been refused.            8.	  On 14 June 2012 Mr Kunene arrived home at around noon having done a night                 shift and was told that Ndingeko was not feeding properly. He noticed that his               son’s  health  had  deteriorated.  He  appreciated that  this  was  something  serious            and that his son might be close to death. He thought that he was suffering from                 low blood sugar and was dehydrated, so he prepared a solution of salt and water                for him. Ndingeko took this and straight afterwards breastfed.          9.	  Mr Kunene went to bed at about 3:00 pm. Shortly afterwards Mrs Kunene took                their son upstairs to have a nap and laid him in bed next to his father. Mr Kunene                   waited until his son fell asleep before allowing himself to follow.            10. Later  Mr  Kunene  was  woken  by  his  wife,  who  said  Ndingeko  was  lifeless.  Mr                Kunene took his son downstairs and tried CPR to no avail.              3 The admitted offence of manslaughter      11. Importantly, Mr Kunene accepts, as he said in interview, that he realised when               he returned from work that day that Ndingeko might die and decided not to call                for  medical  assistance.  On  that  basis  he  accepts  that  he  is  guilty  of  gross               negligence manslaughter.   12. Mr Kunene accepts that he advised his wife that it would be a sin in the eyes of                    God  to  call  for  medical  assistance  as  he  had  made  a  vow  that  he  would  await                 guidance from God before doing so.        13. Mrs Kunene has, in a written basis of plea which is agreed by the Crown, pleaded                  guilty to the offence of gross negligence manslaughter only on the basis of the               omission to act to call for medical attention on 14 June itself. She accepts that                she realised that her baby was very unwell and at risk of death but did so only on                   that day. She adds that on that day itself she did wish to seek medical attention                 for the baby but Mr Kunene said that this would be a sin.               14. Mrs  Kunene  says  that  her  religious  convictions  were  a  significant  factor  in  her               deference  to  her  husband’s  view  that  medical  attention  should  not  be  sought             and her omission to call for medical attention.           Legislation and guidelines    15. The maximum penalty for manslaughter is life imprisonment.          16. By  virtue  of  section  143(1)  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003  this  court  must                consider an offender’s culpability as well as any harm which the offence caused.               17. There is no specific guideline issued by the Sentencing Council or its predecessor               for gross negligence manslaughter. However, general guidance is to be found in             4 the guideline issued by the former Sentencing Guidelines Council on ‘Overarching            principles: seriousness’.   18. It is not suggested on behalf of the Crown that an indeterminate sentence would                 be justified in this case. Nevertheless it is suggested that Schedule 21 to the 2003                Act  is  of  some  relevance.  This  is  because  it  provides  a  clear  indication  by               Parliament of its wish to see sentences for homicide increase by comparison to              the previous position. As Lord Judge CJ said in R v Wood [2010] 1 Cr App R (S) 2,                    at para 23: “this coincides with increased levels of sentence for offences resulting              in  death,  such  as  causing  death  by  dangerous  driving  and  causing  death  by              careless driving. Parliament’s intention seems clear: crimes which result in death            should be treated more seriously and dealt with more severely than before.”             19. In  R  v  Reeves  [2013]  2  Cr  App  R  (S)  21,  which  was  a  case  of  gross  negligence                    manslaughter,  at  para  13,  Treacy  LJ  said:  “it  is  now  beyond  argument  that  the               effect of the Criminal Justice Act has been to lift the level of sentencing in such                 cases… In short, the fact that a death has resulted from criminal conduct is to be                 given  rather  greater  recognition  than  hitherto.  Of  course  all  cases  are  fact             specific but the principle holds good. What might have been seen as a general               indicative figure of two to two and a half years after a trial for this kind of case in                    the past can no longer apply.”       20. The  court  explained  that  the  death  of  the  victim  was  by  definition  great  harm                and that on the facts of that case the Appellant’s culpability was high since she                had  totally  abandoned  her  responsibilities  as a  mother.  In  that  case  there  was              mitigation in the form of the Appellant’s previous good character and absence of              any other suggestion of ill treatment of her children. A sentence of 3 years and 9                  5 months after a guilty plea was upheld on the basis that the starting point after                trial would have been 5 years and a discount of 25% was appropriate given its                timing.  21. The  Crown  submit  (and  I  accept)  that  some  indirect  assistance  can  be  gained                from the guideline issued by the Sentencing Council on offences of child cruelty.              If  Ndingeko’s  life  had  been  saved,  the  Crown  submit  (and  I  accept)  that  the               Defendants’ conduct before 14 June 2012 would have fallen at least within the              third level of that guideline. For that level the guideline suggests a starting point               after trial of 36 weeks imprisonment and a range of 26 weeks to 2 years, where                 the offence involves more than one incident of neglect, not amounting to long‐            term behaviour, or a single incident of long‐term abandonment.  However, in the              present case, there was the additional significant fact that Ndingeko died and the              Defendants accept that they are guilty of manslaughter.           Aggravating and mitigating features     22. In my view, the aggravating features of this case are these:              (1) The victim, as a baby, was particularly vulnerable.          (2) The Defendants failed to heed warnings from relatives that they should seek              medical help from April 2012 onwards at a time when he was apparently unwell.               23. It is accepted on all sides that the following are mitigating features:               (1)  The good character of each Defendant.	  Mr Kunene is now 36 years of age                  and Mrs Kunene is 32.  They are a dedicated and humble couple.              (2)  The  fact  that  the  Defendants  were  otherwise  apparently  good  and  caring             parents of their son.     6 (3)  The  complete  absence  of  any  evidence  to  suggest  that  Ndingeko  had  been              assaulted or ill treated by his parents.        (4)  Not only have the Defendants lost their first child, Mrs Kunene has since had                a miscarriage.   24. I  have  taken  into  account  Professor  Nussey’s  evidence  that  both  the  Darent               Valley  Hospital  and  Northumberland  Medical  Centre  played  a  part  in  failing            properly  to  advise  the  Defendants  and  to  prescribe  vitamin  D  supplements            (Ergocalciferol). The necessity and use of that supplement (which are suitable for             vegans and all the more important as Mrs Kunene is of African origin) was never                explained  to  either  of  the  Defendants.         I  have  also  taken  into  account  the        evidence  of  Dr  Allgrove  and  Dr  Barnard  in  this  context.  As  I  have  already                 mentioned, Ndingeko’s vitamin D deficiency was not diagnosed in the early days             after his birth and before he was discharged from the neo‐natal unit.               The Pre‐Sentence Reports    25. I have read the pre‐sentence reports in the case of each defendant.               26. The  report  in  respect  of  Mr  Kunene  realistically  accepts  that  an  immediate              custodial sentence is likely in this case.  On his behalf counsel has urged me to                 consider suspending any custodial sentence.      27. The  report  in  respect  of  Mrs  Kunene  also  accepts  that  immediate  custody  is  a                real possibility but suggests that consideration be given to whether the sentence             could  be  suspended.  This  has  been  urged  upon  the  court  by  counsel  on  her                 behalf at the hearing before me.       28. I am unable to accept those submissions in view of the seriousness of this case.                  7   Appropriate sentence   29. As I have already said, the sentence must fit the facts of each case.	  I accept that                      this was not as serious a case as that in Reeves on its facts.  Nevertheless, the                   defendants  have  by  their  pleas  accepted  that  they  were  guilty  not  just  of              negligence  but  gross  negligence.  Furthermore,  they  accept  that  they  realised             there  was  a  risk  to  Ndigeko’s  life,  at  least  on  14  June  itself.  They  had  a                   particularly  high  degree  of  responsibility  for  his  health  and  welfare,  as  his             parents,  but they  decided  not  to call  for  medical  assistance  that day.  I accept                  that Mr Kunene’s culpability was higher than that of Mrs Kunene, who wanted to               call for medical assistance that day but deferred to his view.  Furthermore, the               background of the preceding two months is important.  Although the Defendants             did not appreciate the risk of death, they did realise that their son was unwell                but did not seek or obtain medical assistance.         30. The secular courts of this country apply the secular law of the land.  They do so                   equally to all who come before them.  The law respects the right of everyone to                 freedom of thought and belief.  However the right to manifest one’s religion is               not absolute.  It is limited in particular by the rights of others.  The state has a                   particularly important duty to protect the right to life, especially when a young              child is concerned.    31. In  my  view,  having  regard  to  all  the  circumstances  of  this  case,  including               aggravating and mitigating features, the appropriate sentence after trial would           have been 4 years for Mr Kunene; and 3 years for Mrs Kunene.  This is because of                   the difference in their degree of culpability, for reasons I have already set out.                8 32. I propose to give them about 25% credit for their guilty pleas.  I do not give full                      credit of one third in view of the time at which the pleas were entered, which                 was  a  few  weeks  before  the  trial  date  but  not  at  the  earliest  reasonable               opportunity.  This  is  in  fact  greater  than  would  normally  be  the  case  for  pleas                 entered relatively close to the trial date but this is because the Crown have urged                upon  me  that  a  more  generous  approach  is  justified  in  this  case,  since  the               Defendants’  pleas  in  substance  reflect  admissions  they  made  to  the  police  at             their  interviews  and  because  discussions  between  counsel  were  taking  place           about the possibility of pleas being entered before they were.           [The Defendants should now stand.]      33. Mr Kunene: the sentence of the court is imprisonment of 3 years.              34. Mrs Kunene: the sentence is imprisonment of 2 years and 3 months.                35. Unless released earlier, each of you will serve one half of your sentence and will                 then be released on licence until the end of your sentence.  While on licence you                 will be liable to recall by the Secretary of State.           [The Defendants can be taken down.]       Postscript  36. There  is  one  further  aspect  of  this  case  which  I  should  mention.	  Ndingeko                 Kunene’s case was known to Social Services and health authorities from an early              9      stage in his life.  I have been informed that a Serious Case Review has already                   taken place and is due to report shortly.         37. It  is  to  be  hoped  that  all  necessary  enquiries  will  have  been  made  by  those                  authorities to establish that everything was done to protect Ndingeko’s life that             could reasonably have been done.      38. It would not be appropriate for me to comment further since I have not heard                   what others who are not parties to these proceedings and are not represented in               court may have to say about these matters.          10
