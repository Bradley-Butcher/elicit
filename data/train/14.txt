 Regina v. Indre BARYSAITE Dimitrius JAKIMOVAS Sentencing Remarks   1 Indre Barysaite and Dimitrius Jakimovas, the jury have found you guilty of the murder of Zygimantas Kromelys on Sunday 10 November 2019.     You, Indre Barysaite, were engaged to be married to Mr Kromelys.  You,  Dimitrius Jakimovas, were his friend.  Nevertheless, one of you stabbed Mr Kromelys through the heart when the three of you were alone together in  the  home  which  you  shared  in  Rotherham.  The  other  deliberately  assisted or encouraged the stabbing.  Neither of you have explained why you did this.  It remains a mystery.        There does not appear to have been a struggle.  Mr Kromelys was stabbed  only once.  The blade passed between his ribs, through his heart and into  his  lung, which  collapsed.  There was  massive  internal  bleeding,  with  3 litres of blood being found in his chest cavity.  Mercifully for him, death  came quickly.     For his family, however, there is a lifetime of grief.  I have read the moving statement by his sister, Diana Vitkute, in which she has set out in powerful  terms the devastating effect of your actions on every member of his family.      1.	 2.	 3.	 4.	 I have to impose a sentence of life imprisonment.  However, I also have to decide the minimum term which you will serve before you are eligible to be considered for release by the Parole Board.      It  is  important  that  you,  and  everyone  concerned  with  this  case,  should understand what a minimum term means.  A minimum term is not a fixed  term after  which you will  automatically  be released.  It is the  minimum   time which you will spend in custody before your case can be considered  by the Parole Board.  It will then be for the Parole Board to say whether or not you will be released.  If they do not, you will remain in custody.          If and when you are released, you will still be subject to licence.  This will remain the case for the rest of your life.  If for any reason your licence were to be revoked, you would be recalled to prison to continue to serve your life sentence in custody.    The law says that the starting point is a minimum term of 15 years.  I have to consider whether I should adjust that figure up or down, so I have to consider all of the aggravating and mitigating factors.    The principal aggravating factor is the use of a knife.  Although I do not know which of you used the knife, the jury have found by their verdicts that you each intended that Mr Kromelys should be stabbed.     There are three aggravating factors which are particular to you, Dimitrius Jakimovas.  First, you were by your own admission heavily intoxicated.  By contrast, while you, Indre Barysaite, had also had something to drink, there has been no suggestion that you were intoxicated.     Secondly, you, Dimitrius Jakimovas, have accepted that you picked up the  knife and placed it in water in a bowl in the sink.  I am sure that this was an attempt to conceal evidence.  The police did not find it there, so I am sure  that  you  moved  it  again,  rinsing  or  washing  it  and  putting  it  in  the cutlery drawer.  The expert evidence was that three of the knives found in  that drawer could have been the murder weapon and that it was possible that the murder weapon had little or no blood or tissue on it.         Thirdly, you were convicted in 2017 by a court in Lithuania of the infliction in  2016  of  physical  pain  or  minor  bodily  harm,  for  which  you  were  sentenced  to 15  months’ imprisonment, suspended for 18 months.  That was an offence of violence, although it was nothing like as serious as the present offence.  Moreover, you are 33 and it is your only conviction for a violent offence.  2  5.	 6.	 7.	 8.	 9.	 10.	 11.	 12.	  The mitigating factors are as follows.  First, I cannot be sure that either of you intended to kill Mr Kromelys.  That is because I cannot be sure which of you stabbed Mr Kromelys.  There was only a single blow of moderate force.    14.	Secondly, there is no evidence that the murder was premeditated.   Thirdly, you, Indre Barysaite,  are 30 and you have no relevant previous convictions. Fourthly,  I  bear  in  mind  the  additional  burdens  involved  in  a  prison  sentence  served  at  the  present  time  and  served  by  someone  who  speaks little English.      	 Although you, Indre Barysaite, had harmed yourself in the past, between 8 17.	 and 10 years ago, following the death of your daughter, I do not accept that your degree of culpability was lowered by any mental disorder or mental disability.  There has been no medical or other evidence to that effect.    13.	 15.	 16.	 18.	    Similarly,  I  do  not  accept  that  you  were  provoked.  You  did  not  give  evidence to that effect.  You were angry that Mr Kromelys had stopped for a drink on his way back from the shop at about 9 pm and you questioned him  repeatedly  about  it.  Mr  Jakimovas’  evidence  was  that,  on  that occasion,  Mr  Kromelys  had  one  swig  from  a  200  ml  bottle  of  vodka, equivalent to about a double measure of vodka.            	 His drinking was a regular source of arguments between you, but you had 19.	been with him all evening when he had been drinking.  The three of you went  to  a  shop  and  alcohol  was  purchased.  You  were  aware  that  Mr Jakimovas twice went with him to another shop, where more alcohol was purchased each time.  Moreover, after the event, in a conversation recorded on a police officer’s body worn video camera, Mr Jakimovas said that it was you who had been provoking.        20.	 I have to make an order that you each pay a victim surcharge.  The order will be drawn up in the appropriate amount.     21.	Indre Barysaite, I impose on you a sentence of life imprisonment.    22.	   I fix the minimum term which you will serve in custody at 14 years, less the time which you have spent in custody on remand.  I am told that you have spent 416 days in custody on remand, so the minimum term will be If  that  figure  is  wrong,  it  can  be  corrected 12  years  and  315  days. administratively, without the need for you to come back to court.          3  	 Dimitrius Jakimovas, I impose on you a sentence of life imprisonment.   23.	 24.	  I fix the minimum term which you will serve in custody at 14 years and 8  months, less the time which you have spent in custody on remand.  I am  told that you have spent 416 days in custody on remand, so the minimum  term  will  be  13  years  and  132  days.  If  that  figure  is  wrong,  it  can  be     corrected administratively, without the need for you to come back to court.                    Mr Justice Lavender 31  December 2020   4
