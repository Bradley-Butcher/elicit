 R v Daniel Crompton In the Crown Court at Manchester 18 March 2014 Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Turner Daniel Crompton you have been found guilty of the murder of Frank Worsley: an innocent and defenceless 87 year old man. After an afternoon and evening of drinking and drug taking you ran out of money to fund further purchases of cocaine. You had already committed one despicable offence of burglary at the house of people known to you and whom you knew to be out. You used the proceeds from that burglary to buy cocaine.  After midnight, you decided that you would offend again. Having had the opportunity to hear the evidence, I am satisfied that you formed the specific intention to carry out a second burglary to make more money to buy yet more drugs. I find that you chose Mr Worsley’s house because the bathroom window was open. I reject your story that you were intending to break into you mother-in-law’s house, which you believed to  be  unoccupied,  and  did  not  realise  that  you  were  in  the  wrong  house  until  you  first encountered Mr Worsley. You neither knew nor cared if the house were occupied, so great was  your  craving  for  further  cocaine.  The  open  window  provided  the  opportunity.  Your craving for drugs provided the motive. The fact that you were already under the heavy influence of alcohol and cocaine dulled your senses to the likely consequences which, in this case, could hardly have turned out to have been more serious.          1 Your state of mind is amply evidenced by your reaction when Mr Worsley, still in his own bed and wakened by your intrusion into his bedroom in the middle of the night, told you to leave. You demanded to know where he kept his money. Moreover,  I  am  satisfied  from  the  evidence  that  you  proceeded  to  hit  him  in  the  face  on more than one occasion when he refused to tell you in an effort to beat the information out of him. You used your fist wrapped in your top. I am in no doubt that the use of the top was solely to protect your hand and not to mitigate the harm to Mr Worsley. This assault caused diffuse axonal brain damage and a sub-dural haematoma. The force of the  blows  was  at  a  level  to  be  expected  to  be  consistent  with  such  as  would  be  likely  to cause  concussion.    Regrettably,  the  treatment  for  the  haematoma  in  hospital  involved increasing  the  risk  of  the  formation  of  blood  clots  by  reversing  the  effects  of  the  blood thinning  drugs  which  Mr  Worsley  was  taking  for  his  heart  condition.  Clots  formed  and lodged in his brain causing two major strokes leading on to deterioration and death. You on the other hand, while Mr Worsley was on his way to hospital, were busily spending the money you had taken from him on yet more cocaine. But for your carelessness in leaving a handprint at Mr Worsley’s address, you might have got away with it. After  your  arrest,  you  showed  no  initial  remorse  and  did  not  co-operate  with  the  police choosing instead to offer no comment interviews. Your attack on Mr Worsley was as brutal as it was cowardly. The jury has found that when you attacked Mr Worsley you intended to cause really serious injury. This attack caused Mr Worley’s death and so you are guilty of murder. There is only one sentence for murder. It is life imprisonment. But the law requires me to fix the period which must pass before you are eligible for release on licence, or to decide that you should never be released.           2 The minimum term which I will impose should not be confused with a determinate sentence of the same length. Because a determinate prisoner is released at the half way point in his sentence, a life sentence with a minimum term is the equivalent of a determinate sentence of  double  that  length.  So  for  instance,  a  25  year  minimum  term  is  the  equivalent  of  a determinate sentence of 50 years.  And there are two further important differences. A determinate prisoner knows that he will be released at the half way point. Someone sentenced to life imprisonment, as you will be, will  have  no  guarantee  of  release  once  the  minimum  term  has  passed.  It  will  be  for  the Parole  Board  at  that  stage  to  say  if  it  will  be  safe  for  you  to  be  set  free.  And,  even  then, freedom will be relative. You will remain on licence for the rest of your life. If you commit another offence or otherwise breach your licence, you may be re‐detained. Under paragraph 5(1)  of schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 Act where the court considers that the seriousness of the offence is particularly high and the offender is over the age of 18 then the appropriate starting point is 30 years. Under Paragraph 5(2), cases which would  normally  fall  within  this  category  include  a murder  done  for  gain  such  as a  murder done in the course or furtherance of robbery or burglary. It is important to recognise that use of the word “normally” means that not every murder done  in  the  course  or  furtherance  of  robbery  or  burglary  automatically  attracts  a  starting point of 30 years. As the Lord Chief Justice observed in R v Cole [2008] EWCA Crim 1060: “We are concerned that at the sentencing hearing there appears to have been a somewhat mechanistic or arithmetical approach in this case, an approach perhaps encouraged by the terms  of  Schedule  21.  Schedule  21  is  intended  to  provide  general  guidance  to  the assessment  of  the  seriousness  of  an  offence.  The  factors  set  out  in  paragraph  5(2)  are factors  which  will  normally  lead  the  court  to  conclude  that  the  offence  was  one  of particularly  high  seriousness.  If  it  does,  then  the  section  lays  down  a  starting  point  for arriving at the minimum term of 30 years. But whether the court starts at 15 or 30 years, the sentencing exercise requires an assessment of the seriousness, having regard to the facts of       3 the particular case; and that can result, quite properly, in a sentence that is some distance from the starting point that has been taken.” Further,  the  case  of  Bouhaddaou  [2006]  EWCA  Crim  3190  emphasises  the  seriousness  of murders committed in the furtherance of burglary. In this case I am of the view that the element of gain in this case was not one which goes to the  heart  of  the  your  culpability  and  bearing  in  mind  the  lack  of  premeditation  and  the relatively low sums involved I am not satisfied that paragraph 5(1) is engaged. I take, therefore, the starting point to be that of 15 years but having done so must go on to weigh the aggravating and mitigating features. Particular aggravating features: 1.  The advanced age of your victim. 2.  The fact that the attack took place in his home at night. 3.  The fact that your selfish motive was gain. (Although the significance of this element does not serve to put the case in the 30 year category it still falls to be taken into account as a serious aggravating factor at the lower starting point). 4.  Your previous convictions. Particular mitigating features: 1.  Lack of premeditation. 2.  Lack of intent to kill. 3.  Your relative youth. 4.  The evidence of albeit late-flowering remorse when in custody awaiting trial.  The case of Cole, which I remind myself is not a guideline case and provides no more than a pointer,  also  involved  a  fatal  attack  perpetrated  by  a  drug  addict  upon  a  pensioner  living alone. The Court of Appeal raised the minimum term of 18 years imposed by the trial judge to one of 22 years. 4           The circumstances of that case were different to this in this case in a number of respects: 1. It involved a far more sustained and physically violent attack. There were 24 injuries to head and neck alone 2.  The perpetrator disconnected his victim’s telephone after the attack. 3.  The  murder  had  been  preceded  by  a  protracted  and  pitiless  fraud  perpetrated  by the defendant upon his victim in the period up to the attack. 4.  The defendant was older than you are.  Taking  a  starting  point  of  15  years,  I  find  that  the  aggravating  features  outweigh  the mitigating  features  in  your  case  to  the  extent  that  the  minimum  tern  should  be  adjusted upwards  to  one  of  18  years.  On  counts  two  and  three  the  sentence  is  one  of  eighteen months imprisonment on each allowing for credit of one third for the guilty pleas. These run concurrently to each other and to the sentence for murder.  You will be given credit for such time as you have already spent in custody and will pay the victim surcharge. You may take him down.      5
