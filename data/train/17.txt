Central Criminal Court    R  ‐v‐ Ben Butler    21 June 2016    Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Wilkie       Ben Butler you have been convicted by the jury of the murder of your 6 year daughter Ellie on   28th October 2013 and of child cruelty to her early in October.                                     You murdered her in a brutal assault prompted by your evil temper. You struck her head so hard   against a flat surface, or hit her so hard on the head with a blunt implement that, whether you   hit her once or more than once, you inflicted catastrophic skull and brain injuries from which she  very quickly died.                                                          This  is  not  the  case  of  an otherwise  good  parent  who,  in  a  moment  of  exhausted  frustration,  gives way to a bad tempered assault with such disproportionate force that a young child dies,   leaving that parent distraught and full of remorse. In such a case any court would, despite the  horrific  nature  of  the  offence,  be  obliged  to  feel  some  compassion  and  would  temper  the   inevitable lengthy sentence accordingly.                                                      Your case is quite different. I am satisfied, having conducted this trial and having observed you   closely for in excess of 2 months, that you were very far from being a good parent.                                        You are a self absorbed, ill tempered, violent and domineering man who, I am satisfied, regarded   your children and your partner as trophies having no role other than to fit in with your infantile  and sentimentalised fantasy of family life with you as the patriarch whose every whim was to be   responded to appropriately.                                                        Having been granted care of your two young children, you were totally incapable of coping with  the  reality  of  bringing  them  up,  lively,  mischievous,  and  sometimes  not  compliant  with  your  wishes.  Within weeks, you were complaining in vilely abusive and self pitying terms of your lot   and were taking out your inadequacies on your partner, violently and vilely, both physically and   verbally. Within a year Ellie was dead having suffered a series of injuries, some serious, in the  last few weeks of her life.                                                                                          I am satisfied that from, at the latest, late summer 2013 you subjected Ellie to a series of physical   attacks, when she was in your sole care, in which she sustained injuries for none of which you  sought medical attention. You lied to Jennie Gray about how she came by these injuries and she,   totally beholden to and dominated by you, felt she had no option but to believe you and collude  in your ill treatment of her. As a consequence, Ellie was kept away from school for significant   periods  during  which  you  and  Jennie  Gray  told  lies  to  the  school  and  to  the  GP  who,  on  one   occasion, wrote a careful letter for the school recording what she was told was the reason for  Ellie’s absence.                                                                                              1    I am satisfied that, on 1st  October, you inflicted a serious injury on Ellie, a fractured scapula, for     which you and Jennie failed to seek medical attention though you must have known she would  have been in pain                                       Thus it is that when, on the 28th  October, you, feeling under the weather and trying to catch up  with your chores, lost your temper with Ellie and attacked her with lethal violence, it was not a   tragic aberration but was all too consistent with your treatment of, and your attitude towards,   her.                                             That this was so is eloquently evidenced by what came next. Far from collapsing in distress and   remorse, as any decent person would, given behaviour to their child a fraction of the seriousness  of yours, your default position of selfish callousness came into play.                                            You calmly went about creating an alternative version of what had happened, diverting attention  away  from  yourself  and  towards  a  possible  accident  for  which  you  could  not  have  been  responsible  because  you  were  not  in  the  house  at  the  time,  an  alternative  version  which  you     have maintained, in some or other form, to this day.                                                      You arranged the scene of her death to suggest a fall from a chair. You peremptorily summoned    Jennie  gray  home,  telling  her  whatever  lie  would  bring  her  home  urgently.  You  exploited  and  manipulated your friend Iain Hudson, engaging in phone communication giving the impression of   normality shortly before Jennie’s arrival home and ensured that it was on the record by texting  him after phoning him.                                                                                               On Jennie Gray’s arrival home you prevailed on her to delay calling 999 until you had completed   your arrangements which, most wickedly, involved hinting that it was she who had been the only  adult in the house when Ellie met her death. You arranged the cake charade, you had a clothes  wash put on, a display of normality and, in all likelihood, to conceal evidence of Ellie’s blood on  Jennie’s  blouse  which  would  place  Ellie’s  death  much  earlier.  You  went  out,  walked  the  dog,   disposed  of  incriminating  evidence  and  gave  a  bravura  performance,  for  the  neighbours,  of   cheery  normality  which  would  cause  them  to  remember  and  would  serve  to  confirm  the   narrative  you  were  constructing.  You  even  involved  Ellie’s  younger  sibling  in  the  fiction,  to  “discover”  Ellie  and  to  contribute  to  the  shocking  999  call.  You  may  well,  in  addition,  have  inserted the Peppa Pig DVD in the DVD player to assist and support the fiction of her jumping   and falling.                                                                                                          All of this took some two hours during all of which you left your dead daughter lying unattended  on her bedroom floor like a carefully placed prop in a stage scene.                                Your performance in the 999 call was not only breath taking in its level of deceit, but your cruel  disregard for any dignity to be afforded Ellie, lying there dead, is evidenced by her body being   subjected repeatedly to cCPR by Jennie Gray, I have no doubt at your suggestion,  all to serve the     cover up. In my judgment this was cynicism and selfishness at an almost unbelievable level.                                                                Thereafter you brazenly maintained the lie and obtained that Jennie Gray should do so too until   it became obviously unsustainable in its initial form and you replaced it with another set of lies in   may 2015 which you maintained in this court.                                     The only sentence i can pass on you for murder is life imprisonment and i do so.                     I  have  to  fix  a  minimum  term  before  the  expiration  of  which  you  will  not  be  considered  for   release on licence.  It is possible that you may never be released but, in any event, you will not                                     2    be released on licence until the minimum term has expired. Once, if ever, you were released on   licence you would be subject for the rest of your life to its conditions and liable to recall to prison   at any time if you were to be in breach of them.                                                            For murder, pursuant to schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, it is common ground that  the starting point is one of 15 years. There are some mitigating features: no intention to kill; lack  of premeditation; the stress you had been under for a number of years, though in my judgment   that carries little weight. On the contrary, you knew you were failing as a parent and you went to  great lengths to conceal your difficulties from the independent social workers who might have   relieved you of a burden you were clearly unfit to perform safely.                                                                                                                             However there are a number of serious aggravating factors both statutory and additional. You  are a man with a history of violence both outside and, as i have concluded, within the home. I    have to sentence you for child cruelty as well as for murder. I have concluded that you did inflict   the fractured scapula on Ellie. This will result in an enhanced minimum term as the sentences   will have to be concurrent. Ellie was particularly vulnerable because of her age and history. There   is a gross breach of trust at the heart of your offending. You have deprived Ellie’s younger sibling  of  a  lifelong  sibling  companion.  In  that  regard  your  hypocrisy  in  affecting  outrage  with  the   coroner and your previous legal advisers for failing to prevent Ellie’s cremation is breath taking.  You concealed the fact of her death for your own ends as I have explained. The cover up as I    have  explained  is  a  serious  aggravating  feature  both  in  its  own  right  and  as  it  exposes  the   attitudes which  underpinned and provided the context for the murder.                                                                                                                       Those  aggravating  features  far  outweigh  the  mitigating  features  and  as  a  result  the  minimum  term  which  I  fix  before  you  will  be  considered  for  release  on  licence  is  one  of  23  years  from    today less the number of days spent on remand which will be determined administratively.                                                                For the offence of child cruelty, the focus is on the infliction of the injury to the scapula and the  failure  to  obtain  medical  treatment  for  it.  I  am  satisfied  that  you  did  inflict  the  injury,  that  it   would  have  required  a  severe  blow  to  do  so  and  is  in  itself  a  serious  injury.  In  addition  you  obviously  neglected  her,  failing  to  obtain  any  medical  attention  for  an  injury  which,  I  am   satisfied, would have been painful and disabling for most if not all of the 2 weeks she was kept   away from school during which you went to significant lengths to conceal what had happened to  her. I am also satisfied that this was not an isolated example of cruelty and that she under went  a similar experience at the end of august and as a result of what ever happened on 10th October.                                                                                                                         All  this  adds  up  to  a  serious  case  of  child  cruelty  which  falls  at  the  top  of  category  two.  The  sentence upon you for that is one of 5 years imprisonment which will run concurrently to the life  sentence I have imposed.                                       3    Jennie Gray        I have to sentence you for the offence of Perverting the Course of Justice to which you pleaded   guilty on 21 may 2015 after the jury in that trial had been sworn. You are therefore entitled to    some limited credit for that guilty plea.                                                                 You have, however, in evidence denied that you are guilty of any other than particular d in that   charge. There has, therefore, effectively been a Newton hearing in respect of particulars a, b and   c.  I  am  sure  that  you  have  lied  on  oath  about  your  lack  of  knowledge  why  you  had  been  summoned home on 28th  October. I am also sure that you have lied to the jury about knowing  that the blouse you wore to work was washed to remove blood from it which, I am sure, was   Ellie’s blood on the collar which was deposited when you hugged her body on your return from   work. I am also sure you lied to the jury about having lied to the police about what shirt you   believed you had worn to work that day. I am sure that you are guilty of particulars a,b,c, and d.    Thus your limited credit for a late plea of guilty will be further reduced.                                                                                                                           The jury has found you guilty of the offence of child cruelty on the basis that you knew that Ellie   had sustained a shoulder injury and was in pain and you failed to obtain medical attention for it.                                       I am satisfied that the injury was inflicted on Ellie by Ben Butler on 1st  October so that you must    have known of the pain she was in and you did not obtain medical attention for it for a period of   some two weeks.                                                                    I am prepared to accept, for the purpose of sentencing, that you believed what Ben Butler must   have told you, that her shoulder injury was sustained accidentally and that you were unwilling to  believe  that  he  had  inflicted  it  upon  her.  Even  so,  I  am  satisfied  that  you  withheld  medical   attention and lied to cover the reason she was away from school for selfish reasons namely, to   avoid revealing her serious injury and the neglect, at the least, which must have been involved in  her sustaining it which would have come to light had medical attention been sought. You well  knew  that  such  a  serious  incident  might  well  result  in  Ellie  and  her  younger  sibling  being   removed from your care so you put your self interest and that of Ben Butler ahead of your duty   of care as a mother to Ellie and her younger sibling.                                                                                                          You were also aware that this was not the first occasion, when in Ben Butler’s sole care that Ellie   had suffered injury which potentially required medical treatment and which was not obtained.                               Under the guidelines I am satisfied that the offending falls within category 3 but towards the top   end. The appropriate sentence, other things being equal would be one of 21 months.                                     I now consider the offence of perverting the course of justice to which you have pleaded guilty.   The offence in question was the murder of your own child by her father and your partner. Your   role was crucial. The cover up was intended to do two things. First to seek to suggest that Ellie   had  sustained  her  fatal  injuries  accidentally  by  falling  from  a  chair,  perhaps  whilst  imitating    Peppa Pig and her tendency to jump up and down.                                                                   The second was to postpone her time of death so that it was discovered when Ben Butler did not   have sole care of her and may have been at a time when he was not in the house and you had  sole care of her. This would serve to suggest both that it was accidental and, if not, to muddy the                                                       4   waters as to which of you did it. The evidence you falsely provided suggested that you may have   been the only one to have had care of her at the relevant time.                                          I have concluded that you rushed home, knowing that something terrible had happened to Ellie.    I am prepared to accept that you believed Ben Butler, as you had on numerous other occasions,   when he told you that Ellie had suffered yet another accident. I am prepared to conclude that  such was the depth of your dependence on Ben Butler and your need to believe him, that he was   able  to  abuse  your  trust  and  gullibility  and  persuade  you  that  the  deceit  you  were  about  to  embark on was necessary to protect him, an innocent man, from a second round of injustice.                                                                                                             It may be that you were exceptionally naïve and stupid to believe him, but you still had to carry   out the plan and you did so with total commitment and you have continued to do so in this court  by lying to the jury about matters you well knew were not true. I am satisfied that you changed   your work blouse and it was washed with your knowledge to conceal the fact that Ellie was dead  by the time you came home. You went along with, and endlessly repeated, the fabrication about  cutting the cake for a treat shortly before the 999 call. You played your full part in the grotesque  charade that was the 999 call whilst subjecting your dead daughter to the indignity of pointless   CPR when you well knew that she had been dead for over 2 hours.                                                                                                          You maintained your false account to all and sundry for 20 months until you pleaded guilty to   this offence on a partial basis which i have concluded does not fully reflect the extent of your   lies.                                    In  my  judgment  the  appropriate  sentence  for  this  offence  after  a  trial  would  be  one  of  three  years imprisonment. With appropriate credit for your plea of guilty the sentence would be one   of 33 months.                                This offence was committed on a separate occasion as and so has to be treated separately to the  offence of child cruelty and the sentences must be consecutive. Giving a total of 54 months.                                                I have to reflect on whether the total sentence I pass is commensurate with your criminality. I        also have to reflect the fact that your part in this offending was the result, as I find it, of your  unquestioning and deluded devotion to Ben Butler who, by a combination of physical, emotional  and  verbal  abuse  so  dominated  you  that  you  were  disabled  from  seeing  what,  to  any  right   thinking  person  would  be  obvious,  that  it  was  he  who  had  harmed  and  hurting  Ellie  on  1st    October 2013 and killed her on 28 October 2013.                                                                        Having  regard  to  these  two  factors  the  total  sentence  I  pass  on  you  is  one  of  42  months.  18  months for the child cruelty offence and 24 months for the offence of perverting the course of   justice those sentences to run consecutively.                                       5
