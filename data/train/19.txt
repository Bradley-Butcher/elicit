     R v MARK WINT   STAFFORD CROWN COURT   5 JULY 2013     SENTENCING REMARKS OF HIS HONOUR JUDGE SIMON TONKING                                                                                                          I sentence you for two offences, both arising out of two incidents of violence,       separated by about 40 minutes, which occurred in the very early hours of the    morning of Friday 13th January of last year, in the street immediately outside the     Newtown public house in City Road, Fenton.     The first incident gives rise to an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily   harm, the second to an offence of manslaughter and, whilst it is the second offence   which is the more serious, I will outline each offence in chronological order.     Assault occasioning actual bodily harm    It has never been in dispute that at about ten to one in the morning of Friday    13th  January  of  last  year,  you  followed  Mr.  David  Heath  as  he  left  the  Newtown    public house in City Road, Fenton and, once outside, within moments you attacked    him by knocking his baseball cap off, headbutting him, punching him to the ground   and then kicking him a number of times.     Almost  all  of  this  you  admitted  when  you  were  interviewed  by  the  police    later the same day – the exception being that you did not admit the full extent of the    kicking which you gave to Mr. Heath, which is clear from the CCTV footage.      This  was  a  brutal  and  vicious  attack  on  a  man  who,  once  he  was  on  the    ground,  was  completely  defenceless.  As  a  result  of  your  attack  Mr.  Heath  did  not    suffer any serious injury, the medical evidence being inconclusive as to whether his  broken nose  occurred at this time or  when he  went  to the  ground  in  the  incident  which  occurred  40  minutes  later;  and  accordingly  the  only  injuries  attributable  to  this assault are a small cut to the top of the nose and swollen lips.      It is plain that this attack did not happen out  of the blue and, as you have    always maintained, I am prepared to accept that Mr. Heath had been taunting you                                                                                                                                                                                    1                                                                                                        You have been found guilty by the jury of the offence of manslaughter, which    and, as he went to leave, turned to you and voiced some final insult. That however  cannot possibly explain, let alone excuse, what you did.     Putting this  assault  in  the  context  of  the  Sentencing  Council  Guideline, this     was a sustained attack involving the use of both your head and your foot as weapons   and, whilst the provocation does serve to reduce its seriousness, I am satisfied that it     falls into the most serious category of assaults occasioning actual bodily harm.    I  will  deal  with  other  aggravating  and  mitigating  features,  which  are     applicable to both offences, after I have outlined the factual basis on which I pass   sentence for manslaughter, to which I now turn.      Manslaughter     arises out of the fact that having assaulted Mr. David Heath in the second incident,   he died on 5th February of last year from the injuries which you caused.      This offence was committed in very different circumstances from those which    obtained in the first incident. On this occasion you did not go to Mr. Heath but he  came to you. He did so having gone home by taxi, told his daughter and Mr. Rogers   that he had been beaten up by three men, had his cut cleaned and telephoned Mr.   Lee Platt, who was still at the Newtown, twice. He then returned to the Newtown,    driven by Mr. Rogers, in Mr. Rogers’ car.    His  motive  for  doing  so  is  far  from  clear.  Mr.  Rogers  gave  evidence  that   initially, angered by what he had seen and heard, he wanted to go to the Newtown    alone in order to find out who was responsible and then call the police, but that Mr.   Heath  had  said  he  would  go  with  him.  Mr.  Rogers  also  gave  evidence  that  when  asked, after the second incident, by Miss Smith why he had brought Mr. Heath back   he told her “for his friend Lee”. He denied that he and Mr. Heath had been intent on   revenge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                I am far from sure that these reasons are true:    Firstly, as he conceded, Mr. Rogers did not have any information from which    he could have identified anyone;    Secondly, in the second phone call between Mr. Heath and Mr. Lee, Mr. Lee    had made it clear that he was leaving the Newtown and would not be there if   Mr. Heath returned – so they could not have been going back for him; and    Thirdly, the evidence of the taxi driver who took Mr. Heath home, which was    read by agreement, is that Mr. Heath told him that it wasn’t the last of it and    he was going to go back to the pub with a couple of friends.                                                                                - - -  Furthermore it is clear from the CCTV footage, despite the lack of clear focus   and the fact that not everything is shown, that the second incident began with Mr.    Rogers,  followed  by  Mr.  Heath,  walking  purposefully  across  the  road,  Mr.  Heath                                      2     pointing you out and there then being some kind of altercation in which you moved  backwards, towards a pillar, in what was a plain attempt to avoid Mr. Rogers and Mr.   Heath. After that, Mr. Heath was involved in a scuffle with Miss Smith and then went    (off camera) back to the place where you and Mr. Rogers were.                                                                                                                                                                          This shows, with sufficient clarity, that at the start of this incident it was Mr.    Rogers and Mr. Heath were not simply asking you why you acted as you did in the    first  incident,  but  they  were  themselves  acting  with  some  aggression  and  your   actions were in response to that. Your response, as the jury have decided, was not  defensive  but  aggressive  and,  when  Mr.  Heath  came  back  into  the  path  of  the   camera, you and Miss Smith were facing up to him and it was at this point that you  struck him the single blow which, as the jury have found, caused him to go to the   ground  and  sustain  the  injuries  from  which  he  ultimately  died.  In  short  you  met    aggression with aggression, with consequences which turned out to be fatal.    As a result of this offence you have deprived a family of their son, brother,   father and grandfather, and his many friends of their good friend – and the stress,   anxiety and sheer desolation which this has caused cannot adequately be put into  words, despite the very moving Victim Personal Statements that I have read. Their  loss is indescribable – though several of them try to describe in terms of a massive   void ‐ and their lives have been changed for ever. .        That  serves  to  underline  the  seriousness  of  your  offence:  you  caused  the   death of another man by an unlawful act of aggression. Having said that this is to be     mitigated by the fact that this was very far from being either an unprovoked attack   or one of any intensity, such as the attack which you launched on him in the earlier   incident. It amounted to a single blow, struck in the heat of the moment when you  had been faced with unexpected aggression which included the use of some, albeit  relatively minor, force.                                                                                                                                                                         Turning to the aggravating and mitigating factors of each offence:    Both  offences,  as  your  learned  leading  counsel  has  rightly  accepted,  stem  from the fact that, you had been drinking and whilst you were not completely drunk    alcohol  played its part in  what you did. You  have  previous convictions,  latterly  for  relatively minor offences, which were also fuelled by alcohol and whilst I keep your   convictions in perspective, the last serious conviction now being 14 years ago, they   show that you tend to break the law, including by breaching public order and causing  damage, when in drink.                                                                         So  far  as  the  assault  offence  is  concerned  you  have  the  mitigation  of  your  plea  of  guilty,  for  which  I  will  give  you  full  credit,  and  also  your  immediate     admissions and expression of shame, to the police.                                   You have a degree of personal mitigation in that two witnesses speak of your   qualities as a friend, giving details of the kindness which you have showed to each of   them when they have needed it. Psychiatrists who have examined you in the course                                           3            of these proceedings have highlighted your depression as well as your alcoholism –   and  I  am  told  that  you  have  effectively  stopped  drinking  as  a  result  of  what    happened on that tragic night.    SENTENCE                                                                                 I turn to the sentence which I am to pass. I bear in mind that I am sentencing    you  for  two  separate  offences,  arising  from  two  separate  incidents,  which  I  am    satisfied I must mark by passing consecutive sentences, although I must also do no  more than pass the least sentence that I can to mark the total seriousness of your    offending.   Both  offences  are  offences  to  which  the  provisions  relating  to  dangerous    offenders apply but, given the relatively low level of your offending since 1999, the   facts of each of these offences and what I have read about you in two psychiatric     reports  ‐ I  pause  to  make  it  clear  I have  not  considered  it  necessary, given  all  the   information I have, to direct the preparation of a pre‐sentence report – I am satisfied   that neither offence qualifies you for such a sentence.      In relation to the first assault I have already indicated the category into which    this  falls,  albeit  the  sentence  I  pass  will  reflect  the  aggravating  and  mitigating     features to which I have referred.                                                                                                                          In relation to your offence of manslaughter, I have considered, with counsel,  the case known as Appleby [the cases of R. v. Appleby and other defendants [2009]    EWCA Crim 2693] in which the Lord Chief Justice gave guidance as to how offences   of  manslaughter  committed  without  a  weapon  should  be  considered,  including  offences where death is caused by a single punch often, as in this case, resulting in   the victim falling to the ground with such force and in such a way that a fatal head    injury is sustained.                                                                 In  that  case  the  Lord  Chief  Justice  stressed  the  seriousness  of  any  offence   which involves causing the death of another person – which, in terms of harm, is at  the highest level. He also pointed to the aggravating feature of many cases in which  such  death  occurs  as  a  result  of  violence  in  the  street,  with  the  resulting  impact    which that has on public confidence.                                                                                   In this case, whilst the harm which you did is at that level, your culpability –    your wrongdoing – is mitigated by the fact that your act was not unprovoked but a   response to aggression and, I am satisfied some level of physical force. Mr. Davis QC   has invited me to put the level of sentence in your case into a similar bracket as that   of the cases, within Appleby, of Bryan and Roberts, not least because the man who   died  in  that  case  was  not  wholly  without  blame,  although,  there  are  a  number  of    dissimilarities to your case, some better some worse.     In relation to the offence of Manslaughter, for which there is not credit to be   given for plea, taking account of all of the aggravating and mitigating features and                                                                                        4                                                                        also having in mind the level of sentences which are imposed for this type of offence,   I sentence you to a term of 4 years’ imprisonment.      In relation to the offence of Assault I must give you credit for your plea of      guilty, entered on 23rd August of last year – 10 ½ months ago.  Were I sentencing you     after a trial for this offence on its own, taking account of all of the aggravating and   mitigating factors, but not your plea of guilty, I would sentence you to a term of 2     years’ imprisonment. I would reduce that to give you full credit for your plea of guilty    to a term of 16 months – and since I am to impose this sentence to run consecutively   to your sentence of 4 years, and mindful of the totality of your offending and of the   sentence, I reduce that to a sentence of 12 months – to run consecutively – making a   total of 5 years imprisonment.    Time served in custody will count towards your sentence automatically. I also   certify  that  you  have  spent  506  days  on  remand  on  qualifying  curfew  and  I  direct   that one half of that period – namely 253 days – will count towards your sentence.                                                                                                                       5
