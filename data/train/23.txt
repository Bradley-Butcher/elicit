 R v Matthew Daley Sentencing Remarks by Mr Justice Singh In the Crown Court at Lewes 8 July 2016 Introduction The defendant may remain seated for the time being. This  case  arises  out  of  the  death  of  Donald  Lock,  which  occurred  just  after 8:30pm on 16 July 2015.  Mr Lock was killed after a minor collision between his  car  and  the  Defendant’s  car  took  place  on  the  A24  at  Findon  in  West Sussex. 3. The  Defendant  braked  suddenly  and  Mr  Lock’s  car  bumped  into  the  back  of his car.  Mr Lock got out of his car and asked why the Defendant had stopped.  The  Defendant  then  proceeded  to  stab  Mr  Lock  many  times.    There  were  39 wounds on his body although the pathology evidence at the trial indicated that some of those wounds may not have been caused by separate stabbings.   1.  2.       14. The  most  significant  wound  was  to  the  aorta.    This  caused  massive  internal bleeding  and  principally  accounted  for  the  cause  of  Mr  Lock’s  death.    In addition there was injury to some ribs, to the skull and also to the lungs and the  liver.    The  stab  wounds  associated  with  damage  to  bone  would  have required a severe degree of force.   On  16  May  2016  the  Defendant  was  acquitted  by  the  jury  of  murder  but convicted  of  manslaughter.    It  is  clear  from  the  jury’s  verdict  that  any suggestion  of  lawful  self-defence  was  rejected,  otherwise  there  would  have been a complete acquittal.  This means that the jury must have been sure that, even allowing for the Defendant’s mental illness and deluded perception that he might be under attack, the amount of violence used was unreasonable.  As Dr Ley describes it in his report dated 7 July 2016 (at para. 7.6): “The attack was ferocious and relentless.” 6. Although one possible reading of the jury’s verdict is that they were not sure that  the  Defendant  acted  as  he  did  with  the  intention  to  cause  at  least  really serious  harm,  I  put  that  to  one  side.    In  my  judgment,  the  only  sensible interpretation of the jury’s verdict is that they were satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the Defence had established that the Defendant acted as he did on grounds of diminished responsibility.   Indeed  I  proceed  on  the  basis  that  I  am  sure  that  the  Defendant  acted  as  he did  with  the  intention  to  kill  Mr  Lock  and  not  merely  to  cause  really  serious harm.  This is because of the large number of stab wounds, the severity of the  5.    7. 2force  used  and  all  the  circumstances  of  the  incident  about  which  I  heard evidence during the trial.   8. I proceed to sentence, therefore, on the factual basis that this would otherwise have  been  a  serious  case  of  murder.    The  reason  why  the  Defendant’s culpability  is  reduced  is  because  his  mental  responsibility  for  his  acts  was substantially impaired by reason of his mental condition. The facts 9. Mr Lock was a retired solicitor aged 79 but young and fit for his age.  He was a keen  cyclist.    The  Court  has  before  it  a  victim  personal  statement  by  Sandra Goodlad, Mr Lock’s daughter, which was read in Court by her brother.  I am grateful  to  them  both  and  have  taken  that  statement  into  account.    It eloquently  testifies  to  the  continuing  impact  on  Mr  Lock’s  family  and  many other people who knew and loved him. 10. The Defendant was aged 34 at the time of the offence.  He is a man of previous good character.   took place.   11. The  Defendant  would  help  out  at  Woodland  Stables  and  also  kept  a  pony  at Rogers Farm in Findon.  He had just been to Rogers Farm before this offence 12. A  number  of  eye  witnesses  gave  evidence  at  the  trial  about  what  happened during  the  incident.    Mr  Lock  was  not  aggressive  at  all.    The  Defendant 3      appeared to be calm.  One of the witnesses described the Defendant as being expressionless and looking straight through him.  Another said it was as if he was  possessed.    One  witness  was  struck  by  the  silence  of  the  occasion.  However, one witness did describe there being noise, including shouting.  The Defendant himself, when he gave an account to a doctor later that evening (Dr Jake Harvey), said that he had shouted to Mr Lock:  “Die you fucking cunt”.  I accept that was said during the incident. 13. At the trial evidence was given by Mr Andrew Slater, one of the eye witnesses, about  the  attack.    He  said  that  Mr  Lock  was  flat  on  the  ground  and  the Defendant was hitting him in the head and chest.  Mr Slater tried to intervene and  said  “come  on  mate,  leave  it  out.”    The  Defendant  stopped  and  looked around but then carried on stabbing Mr Lock several times.  He then moved towards his car almost in a crouched position and drove away.   14. Although  the  Defendant  did  not  give  evidence  at  the  trial  he  did  give  an account  to  various  different  people  both  on  the  evening  of  the  offence  and later.    In  particular  the  jury  had  played  to  it  several  hours  of  the  video recording  of  the  Defendant’s  interviews  with  the  police  on  18  and  19  July 2015.   15. The  account  which  the  Defendant  gave  was  that  he  was  afraid  of  what  he thought Mr Lock was going to do.  He could see, as he thought, that the driver in  the  car  behind  his  was  angry  and  aggressive.    His  account  was  that  he reached  for  the  knife  which  he  kept  in  the  car  behind  his  seat  in  order  to     4defend  himself  against  what  he,  wrongly  of  course,  perceived  to  be  an imminent attack on him.   16.  He  explained  that  he  had  bought  the  knife  recently  in  connection  with  his work with his goats.   17. The Defendant said to the police that he wanted to protect the environment of the  car,  not  least  because  he  had  recently  been  driving  a  friend’s  children  in that car.  He felt that this important space was being invaded by someone else.   18. As  is  clear  from  the  evidence  advanced  on  behalf  of  the  Defence,  which  the jury  clearly  accepted  in  reaching  the  verdict  that  it  did,  the  Defendant  was suffering from delusions and not behaving in a rational way. The Defendant’s history 19. The Defendant appeared to have a normal life, although he was a quiet boy at school.  He was intelligent and did well in his exams.  He wanted to qualify as an architect and so did some work with a building business initially and then studied  architecture  at  university.    However,  he  began  to  suffer  from  mental health problems from about the age of 19. 20. It is clear from the evidence which was given at the trial that for many years the  Defendant  was  either  wrongly  diagnosed  or  under-treated.    His  parents had tried valiantly to get help for him from at least 2008.  Although this is not a straightforward case even for the medical professionals, it has now become clear,  consistent  with  the  evidence  which  the  jury  must  have  accepted  at  the trial, that the Defendant suffers from paranoid schizophrenia.  He has suffered 5     for many years from delusions and auditory hallucinations.  It is only recently, while he has been detained in a medium secure unit at Hellingly, that he has received  the  therapeutic  anti-psychotic  medication  which  he  needs  for  that psychosis.    In  the  view  of  the  treating  clinician,  Dr  Roderick  Ley,  the Defendant  has  begun  to  improve  his  mental  health  as  a  result  of  that treatment. 21. It is also clear from the evidence at the trial that there had been a number of previous incidents in which the Defendant had engaged in actual or potential violence against other people as a result of his mental health problems.  The most  serious  was  an  incident  in  June  2012,  which  involved  him  taking  a hammer  to  the  house  of  a  friend  of  his  father’s.    He  had  also  had confrontations with members of the public in the street. 22. In the week before the offence took place the Defendant’s mother in particular was very concerned about his mental health.  She referred to it as a “week of incidents”.    Among  the  stress  factors  which  the  Defendant  suffered  in  that week  were  the  breakdown  of  his  relationship  with  his  girlfriend.    There  was concern  about  his  debt  problems.    He  was  concerned  about  his  car  and  in particular about having to get the MOT done, a task which most people would find simple but which he had great difficulty with, so much so that his mother had to help him with that the day before the offence took place.   23. The Defendant was obsessive about some of his habits; in particular he would run  in  the  South  Downs,  doing  the  equivalent  of  a  marathon  every  day.    He would put ear plugs in his ears, not to listen to music but so that he could keep    6the voices out of his head.  He loved the animals for whom he cared and with whom he found some solace.         Medical evidence 24.  At  the  trial  the  jury  heard  from  three  expert  witnesses  on  behalf  of  the Defence:  Dr  Michael  Lawson,  a  consultant  clinical  psychologist;  Dr  Roderick Ley,  a  consultant  forensic  psychiatrist,  who  (as  I  have  already  said)  is  the treating  clinician  at  Hellingly;  and  Dr  Andrew  Johns,  a  consultant  forensic psychiatrist based at the London and Maudsley NHS trust. 25. At the trial the jury also heard evidence from Dr Philip Joseph, who was called by the Prosecution. 26. For the purpose of this sentencing hearing I have seen fresh reports prepared by  both  Dr  Johns  and  Dr  Ley.    I  have  also  heard  oral  evidence  from  Dr  Ley.  They  are  both  registered  practitioners  for  the  purposes  of  the  Mental  Health Act 1983. 27. I have before me a report by Dr Johns dated 25 May 2016.  He states that the Defendant  continues  to  show  signs  of  psychosis  in  that  he  is  hearing derogatory  voices  every  day.    He  maintains  that  the  main  diagnosis  in  this case  is  paranoid  schizophrenia.    The  Defendant  also  has  marked  and persistent traits of Asperger’s syndrome, without reaching the full criteria for that diagnosis.  He concludes that the fatal attack in this case arose from the overall  effect  of  paranoid  schizophrenia  on  the  Defendant’s  mental  state,  i.e. 7paranoid  misinterpretation,  inability  to  exercise  self-control  and  emotional disconnect from his actions and his surroundings.  Having received an update from Dr Ley, Dr Johns concludes that the Defendant currently shows signs of a  severe  paranoid  psychosis.    At  present  he  has  only  the  most  superficial insight into his illness and the homicide.  Dr Johns is of the opinion that the risk  to  others  is  contained  while  the  Defendant  is  in  his  present,  highly monitored hospital environment.  However, much work remains to be done.         28.  Dr  Johns  strongly  recommends  a  hospital  order  under  section  37  of  the Mental  Health  Act  1983.    He  also  recommends  a  restriction  order  under section 41 of the same Act, as this is necessary for the protection of the public from serious harm.   29. I also have before me a report by Dr Ley dated 7 July 2016 and I heard oral evidence  from  him  at  the  sentencing  hearing.    Dr  Ley  also  recommends  a hospital order under section 37 and a restriction order under section 41 of the 1983 Act.   following terms: 30.  At  para.  7.6  of  his  report  Dr  Ley  describes  the  nature  of  the  offence  in  the “Mr  Daley  stabbed  and  killed  Mr  Lock.    There  was  no  clear provocation for the killing.  Mr  Daley was psychotically unwell at the time.  The attack was ferocious and relentless.” 31.  Having described the Defendant’s progress at Hellingly since the trial, Dr Ley sets  out  his  opinion  and  recommendations  to  the  Court  in  his  report.    He 8expresses  the  opinion  that  “the  offending  was  entirely  due  to  him  suffering from a mental illness.”  See para. 6.7 of his report.    32. I note that at para. 6.6 Dr Ley also states the following: “…  The  jury’s  unanimous  decision  indicates  they  concluded  from the evidence that Mr Daley was mentally unwell at the time of the stabbing.    It  was  noted  that  Mr  Daley  did  show  some  personality traits (narcissistic) which it was suggested may have contributed to the  stabbing.    In  my  opinion  these  personality  difficulties  are intertwined  with  his  Asperger’s  traits  and  both  are  likely  to  be  a consequence of his psychotic illness.” 33.  One of the specific questions which Dr Ley has been asked by the Defence to address  is  whether,  once  treated,  the  Defendant  will  cease  to  be  a  danger  to the public.  At paras. 6.9-6.10 of his report Dr Ley states the following: “6.9 Risk predication is very difficult and imprecise.  However, it is clear  that  Mr  Daley’s  risk  to  the  public  will  be  substantially  and significantly  reduced  once  he  has  made  a  good  response  to treatment.    Currently  he  has  only  shown  a  partial  response  to treatment.    The  biggest  challenge  with  Mr  Daley  is  improving  his ability  to  give  a  reliable  account  of  his  mental  state  to  clinicians.  This  will  likely  take  many  years  of  individual  psychological therapy.    His  mental  state  and  functioning  will  require  close monitoring  in  the  future.    The  need  for  this  will  be  even  more important  if  and  when  he  moves  to  conditions  of  lesser  security.  However  such  a  move  would  not  be  considered  until  there  has been a significant and substantial response to treatment.  It is not possible  to  give  a  time  frame  but  it  is  likely  to  be  a  number  of years.  6.10  Even  when  Mr  Daley  has  responded  well  to  treatment  and made  a  good  recovery,  he  will  require  ongoing  close  monitoring and  supervision  for  the  foreseeable  future  to  ensure  he  remains mentally  well.    With  such  close  supervision  and  monitoring,  the risk  to  the  public  can  be  minimised.    We  do  not  consider  risk prediction  in  absolute  terms  so  would  never  conclude  a  person ceases to be a risk to the public but a person can be considered low or very low risk.” 9     34.  Neither  report  by  Dr  Johns  or  Dr  Ley  expressly  addressed  the  question  of  a possible order under section 45A of the 1983 Act.  In his oral evidence Dr Ley expressed  the  opinion  that  an  order  under  section  45A  would  not  be appropriate.    This  is  because,  he  said,  the  diagnosis  is  of  a  psychotic  illness rather than a personality disorder and that illness is treatable.  Furthermore there  is  no  history  of  violence  outside  the  context  of  the  Defendant’s  mental disorder.  Nevertheless, in my view importantly, Dr Ley said in oral evidence that,  although  the  Defendant’s  mental  illness  reduced  his  responsibility  for the  attack,  he  was  aware  of  what  he  was  doing  and  does  hold  some responsibility for it.   35.  Dr  Ley  also  said  in  oral  evidence  that,  with  appropriate  treatment  the  best that  the  doctors  can  achieve  is  a  low  risk  of  future  violence.    This  will  take many years and, even then, the Defendant will need support and monitoring for the foreseeable future. 36. I must be loyal to the jury’s verdict in this case.  It is clear from that verdict that  the  Defendant’s  responsibility  for  the  homicide  in  this  case  was substantially impaired.  It does not follow that it was completely extinguished.   Sentencing  principles in  cases  of  manslaughter  on  grounds  of diminished responsibility 37. I have been assisted by notes for the sentencing hearing prepared on behalf of the Prosecution and of the Defence. I have been reminded of the provisions of the relevant legislation:  in particular sections 37, 41 and 45A of the 1983 Act.   10     38. I  have  also  been  reminded  of  several  decisions  of  the  Court  of  Appeal (Criminal Division) including R v Vowles [2015] 2 Cr. App. R. (S.) 6.   39. In Vowles, at para. 12 the Court said that: “The  primary  importance  of  the  determination  by  the  sentencing judge  where  the  option  is  either  to  impose  an  indeterminate sentence  or  to  make  a  hospital  order  under  sections  37/41  is  the release regime that will apply to the offender.” 40. The order under section 45A is sometimes known as a “hybrid order”.  This is because  it  enables  the  Court  to  impose  a  sentence  of  imprisonment  but  to make  a  direction  (referred  to  in  the  Act  as  a  “hospital  direction”)  and  also  a direction  that  the  offender  be  subject  to  the  special  restrictions  set  out  in section  41  (referred  to  in  the  Act  as  a  “limitation  direction”).    This  has  the consequence that the offender, instead of being removed to and detained in a prison, shall be removed to and detained in such hospital as may be specified in the hospital direction.   41. As  the  Court  explained  in  Vowles,  at  para.21,  the  advantage  of  making  a hybrid  order  in  an  appropriate  case  is  that  an  offender  sentenced  to  an indeterminate  or  long  determinate  sentence  can  immediately  be  directed  to have  treatment  in  hospital,  but  the  timing  of  his  release  is  subject  to  the decision  of  the  Parole  Board  rather  than  the  First-tier  Tribunal.    The  Parole Board  has  to  take  a  much  wider  view  of  the  risks  to  the  public  than  that Tribunal.           1142. I  have  had  careful  regard  to  the  guidance  given  by  the  Court  in  Vowles,  in particular  at  paras.  51-56.    As  the  Court  said  at  para.  51,  I  must  carefully consider  all  the  evidence  in  this  case  and  not  feel  circumscribed  by  the psychiatric opinions before me.  Where the conditions in section 37(2)(a) are met  I  must  consider  what  is  the  appropriate  disposal.    In  considering  that wider question the matters to which I must have regard include:  “(1)  the  extent  to  which  the  offender  needs  treatment  for  the mental disorder from which the offender suffers;  (2) the extent to which the offending is attributable to the mental disorder;  (3) the extent to which punishment is required; and  (4)  the  protection  of  the  public  including  the  regime  for  deciding release and the regime after release.    There must always be sound reasons for departing from the usual course of imposing a penal sentence and the judge must set these out.”   43. I  also  remind  myself  that  where,  notwithstanding  the  Defendant’s  mental disorder,  there  is  an  element  of  culpability  which  merits  punishment  the imposition  of  a  prison  sentence  may  be  a  proper  exercise  of  discretion:    see Vowles at para. 46, quoting R v Birch (1990) 90 Cr. App. R. 78 (Mustill LJ).  The Court also cited the observations of Lord Lane CJ in R v Castro (1985) 7 Cr. App. R. (S.) 68, where he stressed that the sentence had to be looked at not only from the point of view of the offender but also from the point of view of the public.    44. There is therefore a need to examine the issues with great care and to take into account  not  merely  the  psychiatric  evidence  but  also  broader  issues  such  as the  extent  of  the  culpability  attributable  to  the  Defendant’s  mental  disorder, 12the need to protect the public and the regime on release:  see Vowles at para. 48 and the cases cited more fully there. 45. A hospital order and restriction order under sections 37/41 are more likely to be appropriate in a case where the mental disorder is a severe mental illness rather than a personality disorder, because it is more likely that such an illness may have a direct bearing on the offender’s culpability and because the illness is likely to be more responsive to treatment in a hospital:  see Vowles at para. 50(iii).  I also note that it is very rare for a person to have solely a psychotic illness  such  as  schizophrenia  or  solely  a  personality  disorder,  and  that  a person who suffers from schizophrenia alone is very rare:  see Vowles at para. 50(iv).  In the present case the evidence is that the Defendant does not suffer only  from  paranoid  schizophrenia.   There  are  other  traits,  including Asperger’s and narcissistic traits.  46. I remind myself of the guidance given by the Court in Vowles at para. 53.  The fact  that  two  psychiatrists  are  of  the  opinion  that  a  hospital  order  with restrictions under sections 37/41 is the right disposal is never a reason on its own to make such an order.  I must consider all of the relevant circumstances, including  the  four  issues  I  have  already  set  out,  and  then  consider  the alternatives in the order in which they were set out by the Court in Vowles at    47. First, I must consider whether the Defendant can appropriately be dealt with by  a  hybrid  order  under  section  45A.    If  he  can  then  I  should  make  such  an para. 54. order.    1348. If such a direction is not appropriate I must consider whether the conditions in section 37(2)(a) and (b) are met.  In a case where the Court is considering a life sentence under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, as amended in 2012: “… if: (1) the mental disorder is treatable; (2) once  treated  there  is  no  evidence  he  would  be  in  any  way dangerous; and  (3) the offending is entirely due to that mental disorder,  a  hospital  order  under  sections  37/41  is  likely  to  be  the  correct disposal. …” 49. I turn to consider the question of a possible sentence of imprisonment as part of a hybrid order under section 45A. 50. There  can  be  no  dispute  that  the  offence  of  manslaughter  is  a  serious, specified, violent offence.  The maximum penalty available in law is a sentence of  life  imprisonment.    Although  it  is  normally  a  discretionary  sentence  there are circumstances in which it must be imposed.  Section 225 of the 2003 Act applies where a person aged 18 or over is convicted of a serious offence such as  this  and  the  Court  is  of  the  opinion  that  there  is  a  significant  risk  to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by him of  further  specified  offences.    Subsection  (2)  makes  it  clear  that,  if  the  Court considers that the seriousness of the offence in such circumstances is such as to justify the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for life, the Court must impose that sentence.        1451. In  a  case  where  the  Court  does  impose  a  life  sentence  it  must  then  go  on  to specify  the  minimum  term  which  must  be  served  before  a  person  becomes eligible for consideration by the Parole  Board for release on licence.  I stress that this is the minimum period and the actual period may be longer.  This is because the Parole Board may not make such a direction unless the Defendant is no longer a danger to the public.  Even if he is released the Defendant will then be on licence for the rest of his life and may be recalled to prison by the Secretary of State if he breaches the terms of his licence.   52. Since this is not an offence of murder the terms of Sch. 21 to the 2003 Act do not  as  such  apply.    Nevertheless,  as  the  Court  of  Appeal  explained  in  Att-Gen.’s Reference (No.34 of 2014) (R v Jenkin) [2014] 2 Cr. App. R.(S.) 84, at para. 34, “a nuanced approach must be taken to Sch. 21 so as to reflect the fact of diminished responsibility” and that the greater the residual culpability, “the greater the impact of the Sch. 21 factors.” 53. In  the  present  case  the  Prosecution  submit  that,  if  this  had  been  a  case  of murder, the appropriate starting point would be a minimum term of 15 years.  I would agree but, in my view, the minimum term to be imposed in a case of murder would have been much higher than that in the light of the particular circumstances  of  this  offence,  some  of  which  I  have  already  outlined  in  my earlier  summary  of  the  facts.    It  should  be  recalled  that  this  violent, unprovoked  attack  took  place  in  a  public  place  in  the  presence  of  other members of the public. 54. I also accept that the following aggravating features were present in this case:  15   (1) Mr Lock was vulnerable because of his age; (2) the Defendant used a weapon, that is the knife which he had in his car; (3) the  Defendant  understood  that  he  had  done  serious  injury  to Mr Lock at the very least but fled the scene;   (4) in the immediate aftermath of the attack he took steps to cover his  tracks:    washing  some  of  his  clothes  and  his  hands; throwing  away  documentation  relating  to  his  car  and  even contemplating using a false number plate.        55. It is also clear from the evidence at the trial that the Defendant was planning to leave home and, from what he told his mother on the day after the incident, that he was aware that he done something seriously wrong.   56. These features of the case also make me sure that the Defendant’s culpability in this case was not attributable solely to his mental disorder. 57. Therefore, if this had been a case of murder, my view is that the appropriate minimum  term  would  have  been  at  least  20  years  and  probably  more  in  the region of 25 years. 58.  As is common ground before me the mitigating factors in the present case are the absence of any previous convictions and the Defendant’s mental disorder.   1659. In  sentencing  the  Defendant  I  must  be  loyal  to  the  verdict  of  the  jury  and recognise that his responsibility for the homicide in this case was substantially impaired  by  his  mental  disorder.  That  is  why  there  was  a  conviction  for manslaughter and not murder.  60.  Nevertheless, having carefully considered the principles set out in Vowles and all the evidence before me, I have come to the conclusion that this is not a case in which the Court can simply make an order under sections 37 and 41 of the 1983 Act.  In my view, I can and therefore should make an order under section 45A, in other words a hybrid order, which will both enable the Defendant to receive  the  treatment  he  needs  in  hospital  but  also  permit  of  the  possibility that,  if  he  should  be  released  from  hospital  before  the  custodial  part  of  any prison  sentence  has  expired,  he  could  then  be  detained  in  prison  in  order  to serve a sentence of punishment. 61. In  relation  to  the  punitive  element  of  the  order,  I  intend  to  impose  a discretionary  sentence  of  life  imprisonment.    As  I  have  said,  the  minimum term to be served must be reduced considerably from what it would otherwise have  been  so  as  to  reflect  the  fact  that  the  Defendant  was  convicted  of manslaughter  and  to  reflect  the  other  mitigating  circumstances  in  this  case, including of course his mental illness.    17Days spent on remand 62. I  direct  that  the  time  spent  by  the  Defendant  on  remand  is  to  be  deducted from the minimum term imposed.  On the information before me that is 355 days.    If  that  turns  out  to  be  incorrect,  I  direct  that  it  can  be  corrected 63. The legislation on surcharges applies in this case and an order will be drawn administratively. Statutory surcharge up accordingly.   The sentence of the Court 64. The Defendant should now stand. 65. The  sentence  of  the  Court  is  life  imprisonment  with  a  minimum  term  of  10 years less the time spent on remand as I have already directed.   66. I  direct,  under  the  provisions  of  section  45A  of  the  Mental  Health  Act  1983, that in the light of the psychiatric evidence the criteria for a hospital order are met.    Instead  of  being  removed  to  and  detained  in  a  prison,  you  will  be removed  to  and  detained  in  a  hospital,  namely  Hellingly  Centre  (Medium Secure Psychiatric Hospital).  You will be subject to the special restrictions set out in section 41 of the Mental Health Act without limit of time.   18        67. This means that you will be detained in hospital for as long as necessary.  The time you spend in hospital will count towards the minimum term which I have imposed.    If  and  when  it  is  no  longer  necessary  you  will  be  transferred  to prison.    Once  in  prison  you  will  serve  the  remainder  of  the  minimum  term which I have imposed.  If and when that minimum term has expired, you will be  eligible  for  consideration  for  release  on  licence  by  the  Parole  Board.    On release  from  prison  you  will  be  subject  to  the  conditions  of  your  licence  and also subject to conditions of your release from hospital.  You will be liable to recall by the Secretary of State for the rest of your life.   Postscript 68.  Before I finish I would like to add a few further remarks.   69.  On any view this was a tragic case.  I would like to express my sympathy to the family  and  friends  of  Mr  Lock  for  their  sad  loss.    There  was  evidence  at  the trial  that  the  Defendant  was  for  many  years  under-diagnosed  and  under-treated  for  his  mental  health  problems.    The  Defendant’s  parents  gave evidence  of  the  sustained  and  sometimes  desperate  efforts  they  made  to secure  proper  treatment  for  him.    It  would  be  inappropriate  for  me  to comment further because this has been a criminal trial and not, for example, a public  inquiry.    However,  I  hope  that  the  appropriate  authorities  will  do everything  possible  to  investigate  what  happened  and  to  learn  appropriate lessons for the future.  The public is entitled to no less.      1970. Finally  I  would  like  to  thank  the  police  for  their  efforts  and  to  thank  all counsel for the way in which they have conducted this case.  -ENDS-  20
