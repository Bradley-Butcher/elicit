 The Queen ‐v‐  Joanne Christine Dennehy  Gary John Stretch  Leslie Paul Layton  Robert James Moore    28 February 2014 Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Spencer In the Crown Court at Cambridge sitting at the Central Criminal Court Joanne  Dennehy,  Gary  Stretch,  Leslie  Layton   and  Robert  Moore,  you  may  remain seated for the time being.   Joanne  Dennehy,  within  the  space  of  10  days  at  the  end  of  March  last  year  you murdered  three  men  in  cold  blood.  Although  you  pleaded  guilty  you  have  made  it quite  clear  that  you  have  no  remorse  for  those  murders.  With  the  help  of  one  or more of your co‐defendants you dumped the bodies of your three victims in remote rural areas around Peterborough hoping they would not be found. Only a matter of days later you attempted to murder two more men, this time openly on the streets of  Hereford,  victims  chosen  entirely  at  random.  Miraculously  they  survived.  You claim  to  feel  remorse  for  stabbing  those  two  men  nearly  to  death.  I  have  no hesitation  in  rejecting  that  suggestion.  You  are  a  cruel,  calculating,  selfish,  and manipulative serial killer.   1           You  Gary  Stretch  actively  assisted  Joanne  Dennehy  in  dumping  the  bodies  of  all three  men  she  had  murdered,  making  use  of  your  local  knowledge.  You  were  her driver  in  Hereford  and  stopped  the  car  to  enable  her  to  get  out  and  attempt  to murder  two  more  men.  You  knew  exactly  what  she  was  likely  to  do.  The  jury convicted you of attempted murder as well.   You Leslie Layton actively assisted Joanne Dennehy and Gary Stretch in dumping the bodies  of  two  of  the  three  men  she  had  murdered.  One  of  them  was  your housemate.  The  other  was  your  landlord.  You  had  every  opportunity  to  distance yourself  from  these  crimes.  Instead  you  chose  to  go  along  with  them.  When  the police  were  trying  to  find  your  missing  housemate  and  needed  your  help  as  a member of the public, you repeatedly lied to them to cover your own tracks and to protect Joanne Dennehy and Gary Stretch. Had you told the truth, it is possible they would have been arrested before the attacks in Hereford.   You Robert Moore gave shelter and assistance to Joanne Dennehy and Gary Stretch  for  two  nights  when  you  knew  or  believed  she  had  committed  those  murders  and that he had helped her dump the bodies.   I have to sentence each of you for your part in these appalling offences. Before I do so, however, I need to set out the factual basis on which I sentence you all.   Your  first  victim,  Joanne  Dennehy,  was  a  31  year  old  Polish  man,  Lukasz Slaboszewski.  He  had  come  to  this  country  in  2005.  Somehow  you  met  and befriended  him.  Within  a  matter  of  days  of  meeting  him  you  murdered  him.  He texted  his  friend  to  the  effect  that  life  was  beautiful  now  that  he  had  you  as  his girlfriend.  You  lured  him  soon  afterwards  to  11  Rolleston  Garth  in  Peterborough, where  you  had  been  living.   There   can  be  no  doubt  that  you  lured  him  there specifically to kill him. You stabbed him once through the heart. Whilst you decided how to dispose of his body permanently, you put the body for the time being into a wheelie  bin.  You  made  a  point  of  bringing  a  14  year  old  girl  whom  you  had 2befriended  to  11  Rolleston  Garth  where  you  opened  the  bin  and  showed  her  the dead  body.  You  deny  doing  this,  but  the  detail  of  her  account  is  so  clear  and compelling  that  I  find  it  impossible  to  accept  your  denial.   That  conduct  is  an aggravating  feature  of  the  murder  and  of  the  charge  of  preventing  the  lawful  and decent burial of the body. You set about acquiring a vehicle specifically to dispose of the body. With money you borrowed for the purpose from your landlord and third victim, Kevin Lee, you bought a Vauxhall Astra, travelling with Gary Stretch by taxi to collect it. This was within two days of the murder. Later the same evening, you and Gary  Stretch  were  driving  around  remote  areas  on  the  outskirts  of  Peterborough looking  for  a  suitable  site  to  dump  the  body.  The  site  chosen  was  Thorney  Dyke, close  to  where  you,  Gary  Stretch,  had  lived  some  years  earlier.  You  boasted  to Georgina Page that no‐one would ever find the bodies dumped there.   The  second  man  you  murdered,  Joanne  Dennehy,  was  John  Chapman.  He  was  56 years old. He was murdered a week or so later, probably in the early hours of Friday 29th March, Good Friday. You stabbed him to death in his own bedsitting room at 38 Bifield where by now you were also living. John Chapman was a kindly, harmless and inoffensive man who had served his country in the Royal Navy but had fallen on hard times  through  his  weakness  for  alcohol.  You,  Joanne  Dennehy,  were  well  aware  of that vulnerability and exploited it. You, Gary Stretch, and you, Leslie Layton, met and drank  with  John  Chapman  at  38  Bifield  only  a  matter  of  days  before  he  was murdered. You, Leslie Layton, lived in another bedsit room on the same floor of the building. You, Joanne Dennehy, said or hinted to Georgina Page when you visited her a  few  days  later  that  you  had  killed  this  man  because  he  came  into  the  bathroom when you were having a bath and would not leave. I bear in mind that it is a feature of  your  psychopathic  personality  that  you  are  a  pathological  liar.  There  is  clear evidence that you had threatened John Chapman that you would get him out of the house by any means. Eviction notices had been served on the tenants at 38 Bifield by your landlord and third victim Kevin Lee, someone you wanted to lead to believe you were helping. You had only just moved into 38 Bifield. John Chapman described you to another tenant, Toni Ann Roberts as “the mad woman”. It was she whom he told that he was having problems with you, and that you had said you would get him out   3of the house by any means. I am quite sure that this, once again, was a planned and premeditated killing.   You stabbed John Chapman to death in his own bed sitting room. You stabbed him once in the neck, severing the carotid artery, and five times in the chest. Two of the stab wounds penetrated the heart, one of them inflicted with sufficient force to pass first through the breast bone. There was no injury to suggest that John Chapman had attempted  to  defend  himself.  His  blood  alcohol  level  was  four  times  the  limit  for driving. It may even be that you stabbed him as he lay asleep on his bed.   You, Leslie Layton, had a photograph of John Chapman’s dead body on your mobile phone, a photograph taken at 7.32am that day, not long after the murder. You were never asked about that photograph by the police in interview, because it had been deleted from your phone and had not then been retrieved by forensic analysis. You had the opportunity at your trial to give evidence and tell the jury, if it was truly the case, that you did not take that photograph, did not delete it, and knew nothing of it. You did not give evidence.  Instead the theory was put forward by your counsel in his closing speech that the photograph might have been taken by Joanne Dennehy using your phone and that she might have deleted the image without your ever knowing it was  there.  That  was  only  a  theory.  There  is  no  evidence  to  support  it.  Bearing  in mind  how  critical  the  evidence  of  this  photograph  was  to  the  prosecution  case against  you  in  rebutting  your  defence  of  duress,  and  how  important  it  would  have been be for you to challenge it, I am quite sure that the reason why you chose not to give evidence about this photograph was that you knew it was you who took it and you who deleted it.   Soon after you had murdered John Chapman you, Joanne Dennehy, were using the dead  man’s  mobile  phone.  I  strongly  suspect  that  it  was  you  who  was  using  it  as early as 6.34am to call Gary Stretch, an hour before the photograph was taken, but I cannot be sure of that as the telephone schedule shows that from time to time over the previous few days John Chapman had himself called Gary Stretch, albeit never so early in the morning.      4     When  you,  Leslie  Layton,  were  confronted  with  the  body  of  John  Chapman  early that  Friday  morning  your  reaction  was  not  to  call  for  help  but  to  photograph  the body  for  your  own  purposes  as  a  morbid  souvenir.  That  showed  a  callous indifference to the plight of your housemate. When Gary Stretch came round to 38 Bifield  soon  afterwards  that  morning  you  were  able  to  leave  the  house,  free  of threat or fear, and you went out shopping with a friend. You could and should have raised  the  alarm  then,  but  instead  you  chose  to  meet  up  again  with  Gary  Stretch later that afternoon knowing that the body of John Chapman still lay upstairs in the room  where  he  had  been  murdered.  You  played  your  part  in  helping  to  dump  the body of John Chapman later that night, in the same ditch at Thorney Dyke where the body of Lukasz Slaboszewski lay undiscovered. I shall return to that.   The third man you murdered, Joanne Dennehy, was your landlord Kevin Lee. He was 48 years old, a much loved husband and father. By a combination of bad judgement on  his  part  born  of  genuine  compassion  and  desire  to  help  you,  and  the  strange fascination  that  you  held  for  him,  as  you  did  for  other  men,  Kevin  Lee  became infatuated with you. Over a period of several months you led him to believe that you had been grossly abused as a child and even that you had killed your own father and served many years in prison as a result. That was pure fantasy. You had a perfectly decent  and  proper  upbringing  and  the  advantage  of  a  good  home.  Kevin  Lee befriended you, gave you employment in his property letting business and provided you with accommodation in a series of bedsits in the houses his company owned and rented  out.  Your  relationship  with  Kevin  Lee  became  so  close  that  you  felt  able  to confide in him that you had committed the first murder. You were to tell Georgina Page later that it was because he had seen the body that you had to kill Kevin Lee. That may be part of the reason, but it was only part. I am quite sure that the reason you murdered Kevin Lee in the way that you did, and dumped his body in the way that you did, was to gratify your own sadistic lust for blood.   Like  your  first  victim,  you  lured  your  third  victim  Kevin  Lee  to  11  Rolleston  Garth specifically in order to murder him. You had whetted his appetite sexually by telling 5him  that  when  he  came  to  see  you  that  Friday  afternoon  you  were  going  to  dress him up and rape him. That is what he told his best friend Dave Church when he met him  that  afternoon  on  business  less  than  an  hour  before  his  fatal  rendezvous  with you  at  Rolleston  Garth.  It  was  not  the  first  time  Kevin  Lee  had  described  to  Dave Church the sort of extreme sexual activity you and he were taking part in together. You  stabbed  Kevin  Lee  five  times  in  the  chest.  The  wounds  penetrated  both  lungs and  the  heart.  This  time  there  were  injuries  to  suggest  that  your  victim  tried  to defend himself.   With  two  dead  bodies  now  to  dispose  of,  at  two  separate  addresses,  you  Joanne Dennehy  and  you  Gary  Stretch  were  seen  by  various  witnesses  engaged  in  the cleaning up operations. Then in the evening, with you as well now, Leslie Layton, the three  of  you  set  about  dumping  these  two  bodies  and  covering  your  tracks.  You, Leslie  Layton,  I  am  quite  satisfied  on  all  the  evidence,  were  a  wholly  willing participant  in  getting  rid  of  the  bodies  and  setting  fire  to  Kevin  Lee’s  Mondeo  car. The  three  of  you  travelled  to  another  remote  rural  area  on  the  outskirts  of Peterborough at Newborough to dump the body of Kevin Lee. You, Joanne Dennehy, had  indeed  dressed  Kevin  Lee  in  a  black  sequinned  dress  of  your  own.  As  a  final humiliation, his body was dumped in the ditch still wearing that dress, with his naked buttocks exposed. I have studied the photographs of his body as it was found in the ditch, rather than rely on the sanitised photograph which, quite properly, was all the jury were allowed to see. I am quite satisfied that Kevin Lee’s body must have been deliberately  positioned  or  deliberately  left  that  way,  with  his  bare  buttocks prominently exposed upwards, still wearing the sequinned dress.  I  am  prepared  to  accept,  however,  that  you,  Leslie  Layton,  played  no  part  in  that and,  as  you  told  the  police,  did  not  get  out  of  the  car  on  that  occasion.  But  you, Leslie Layton, were active in driving the Mondeo, probably with Kevin Lee’s body in the  boot,  and  as  the  CCTV  clearly  showed  you  were  prominent  in  obtaining  petrol with which to set fire to and destroy the Mondeo. This was done on an area of waste ground at Yaxley quite deliberately chosen, I am sure, to be as far away as possible    6from  where  Kevin  Lee’s  body  had  been  dumped,  out  beyond  the  other  side  of Peterborough.   The  three  of  you  then  returned  in  the  Astra  to  38  Bifield  where  the  body  of  John Chapman was loaded into the car. You, Leslie Layton , admitted in interview that you played an active part with Joanne Dennehy in carrying his body downstairs from the top floor. It was probably his body that you, Gary Stretch, were seen carrying to the car and putting in the boot, causing the suspension to drop. The three of you drove out  to  Thorney  Dyke  where  John  Chapman’s  body  was  dumped  in  the  same  ditch where  the  body  of  Lukasz  Slaboszewski  still  lay.  This  time  you  got  out  of  the  car, Leslie  Layton,  and  must  have  seen  there  was  another  body  already  there.  The  jury rejected  your  defence  of  duress.  You  had  ample  opportunity  in  the  course  of  that day to distance yourself from Joanne Dennehy and Gary Stretch. It was fascination not  fear  which  led  you  to  stay  with  them  and  help  them  to  dispose  of  the  bodies. That is why you had no qualms about accepting Gary Stretch’s offer to stay at his flat overnight.   You Gary Stretch, also relied on the defence of duress before the jury. Whatever the true  nature  of  your  relationship  with  Joanne  Dennehy  there  is  not  a  shred  of evidence  that  you  were  ever  in  fear  of  her.  Had  you  been,  you  would  not  have dispensed with the gun which I am sure you had in your possession when you went on the run to Hereford two days later.   You, Leslie Layton, and you, Robert Moore, were more than willing to given Joanne Dennehy  and  Gary  Stretch  whatever  assistance  they  wanted  in  evading  the  police, even  though  you  knew  full  well  that  murders  had  been  committed  and  bodies dumped.  Leslie  Layton  told  the  police  that  it  was  from  your  house,  Robert  Moore, that the tarpaulin was borrowed in which to wrap or carry the bodies that Friday. I do not sentence you on the basis that you lent them the tarpaulin knowing why it was needed.  That allegation has never been made. But you knew that the body of the first victim had been stored for a while in a wheelie bin at 11 Rolleston  Garth, close to where you lived. That much is apparent from what you told the probation     7officer,  although  you  made  no  comment  in  interview  when  the  police  questioned you on the topic. It is quite clear, not least from the text messages you sent her, that you  were  besotted  with  Joanne  Dennehy  and  prepared  to  do  almost  anything  to indulge  her.  Knowing  what  she  and  Gary  Stretch  had  done you  were  willing  to  put them  up  in  your  house  and  willing  even  to  expose  your  young  daughter  to  their influence.  When  they  could  not  return  to  their  own  accommodation  because  the police  were  looking  for  them,  you  provided  them  with  food  and  shelter  for  two nights running, Saturday 30th and Sunday 31st March..   Over that Easter weekend you, Leslie Layton, were undoubtedly wracked with guilt and worry over what you had done. That is why your friends Toni Ann Roberts and Michelle Bowles described you as distressed and upset on the Sunday evening when they spoke to you. That did not stop you trying to cover your tracks, however, nor did  it  induce  you  to  go  to  the  police  and  tell  them  what  you  knew  about  the disappearance  of  John  Chapman  which  was,  by  now,  headline  news  in  the  media. Instead,  when  the  police  came  to  see  you  on  Sunday  31st  March  and  again  on  the afternoon of 1st April you lied time and again in denying all knowledge of what had become  of  John  Chapman.  You  said  you  had  not  seen  him  since  the  previous Wednesday or Thursday. In fact on the Friday night you had helped to dump his dead body  in  a  ditch.  You  said  you  had  not  seen  Joanne  Dennehy  since  the  previous Wednesday. You lied to the police in a determined attempt to pervert the course of justice. The jury rejected your defence of duress. By now Joanne Dennehy and Gary Stretch were far away in East Anglia. All you had to do was tell the police the truth if you had the remotest concern for your own physical safety. I am sure you did not. You were thinking only of yourself and your friends in crime. Whilst the police were speaking to you that Monday afternoon you had several calls from Joanne Dennehy, calling you on the phone of the dead man the police were asking you about. As soon as  the  police  had  left,  you  rang  Joanne  Dennehy  back,  no  doubt  to  report  the progress of the police investigation as you knew it, as she had requested you should in a revealing earlier text message you neglected to delete from your phone.    8  On  the  Monday  evening,  you,  Joanne  Dennehy  and  Gary  Stretch,  paid  a  visit  to Georgina Page in King’s Lynn. There you both talked in a matter of fact way about the  murders.  It  was  there  that  you,  Gary  Stretch,  boasted  that  the  bodies  would never be found. You, Joanne Dennehy, became excited and animated when you saw reports  on  television  that  you  were  wanted.   Ecstatic   was  the  way  Georgina  Page described you to the jury. You told her that when you dressed Kevin Lee up you had lubricated his backside and shoved something up it to make it look as though it was a sexual act. I am quite sure that you, Gary Stretch, did threaten Georgina Page before you  left  her  house,  saying  that  you  would  get  your  father  to  sort  it  out  if  anyone grassed on the two of you. Georgina Page told the jury that she understood by this that if she went to the police she might be killed. You, Joanne Dennehy, said that you knew the two of you would get caught and go to prison for a long time. You, Gary Stretch,  laughed  and  said  “My  kids  are  grown  up,  so  I  don’t  care”.  The  two  of  you returned to Peterborough and spent a second night at Robert Moore’s home.    Early  on  Tuesday  morning,  2nd  April,  you  set  off  together  from  his  home  for Hereford.  You  chose  Hereford  because  it  was  somewhere  Gary  Stretch  knew  well. You had burgled a house at Diss in Norfolk the previous day. This time you burgled another  house  in  Herefordshire  looking  for  valuable  electrical  items  you  could  sell easily. By now the two of you were well and truly on the run and your behaviour was totally lawless.  You met up with other criminals at a flat in Kington, about 20 miles from Hereford on the Welsh border. The two of you, and the rest of the group you met, agreed to sell  the  stolen  property  to  someone  in  Hereford  with  whom  there  would  be  a rendezvous. One of the men in the group you met was Mark Lloyd. He gave evidence at the trial over a long period and, like the jury, I had a good opportunity to assess him. I bear in mind the need for caution in relation to his evidence. However, I am quite  sure  he  was  not  a  willing  passenger  in  the  Vauxhall  Astra  when  it  set  off  for Hereford.  I  am  also  sure  that  before  you  left  the  flat  in  Hereford  there  was  an incident  in  the  kitchen,  out  of  sight  of  Joanne  Dennehy,  when  you,  Gary  Stretch, showed  Mark  Lloyd  a  hand  gun  which  was  in  the  waistband  of  your  trousers.    9Whether  the  gun  was  in  fact  loaded,  as  Mark  Lloyd  believed  on  the  basis  of  his experience of such weapons, matters not. His evidence that you were in possession of such a gun was not challenged in cross‐examination, although I accept that it was your  counsel’s  judgment  not  to  challenge  it.  I  accept  too  that  you  had  denied  in interview having such a gun, but you told many important lies in your interviews, so that  denial  counts  for  very  little.  Nor  did  you  give  evidence  to  contradict  Mark Lloyd’s evidence about the gun, where any denial would have been tested.  I  am  sure  that  you  did  have  such  a  gun  in  your  possession,  and  sure  that  you  led Mark Lloyd to believe you had it with you to rob a drug dealer if you could find one. You left the flat and disposed of the gun somewhere before the journey to Hereford began.  That  is  significant  in  itself  because  it  shows  you  were  not  truly  in  fear  of Joanne  Dennehy  and  did  not  consider  that  you  needed  a  gun  for  your  own protection against her. It is more likely, in my judgment, that you realised you were bound  to  be  apprehended  by  the  police  sooner  or  later  and  did  not  want  to compound your criminality by being caught in possession of a firearm. The fact that you had access to such a gun is, however, relevant to the danger you may pose to the public. I shall return to that.   Either before the journey to Hereford began, or during the course of the journey, I am quite sure that you, Joanne Dennehy, said words to the effect that Gary Stretch had  already  had  his  fun,  in  the  sense  of  carrying  out  the  burglary,  and  now  you wanted your fun. I am also sure that you said earlier, at the flat, that you had killed three people, that Gary Stretch had helped to dispose of the bodies, and  you had to do  some  more.  By  the  time  you  arrived  in  Hereford  I  have  no  doubt  that  you  had already  formed  the  intention  of  killing  at  least  one  more  man,  at  random,  by stabbing him to death, and that you Gary Stretch knew perfectly well that this was bound to happen.  In the event two men were nearly killed, not one.   On the jury’s verdicts you, Gary Stretch, either shared Joanne Dennehy’s intention to  kill  the  two  men  she  stabbed  in  Hereford  or  at  the  very  least  realised  that  she would stab them with the intention of killing them. On the facts of this case there is     10no real difference. One way or the other you foresaw the inevitability of what was going to happen and you played your part in bringing it about.   I am quite sure on the evidence that it was you, Gary Stretch, who spotted the first victim, Robin Bereza, as you drove down the road. He was walking his dog ahead of you on the nearside pavement. You lied to the police in interview in suggesting that you had pulled up only after passing him and you lied in suggesting that you did not see what happened because it was taking place behind the car. The truth, I am sure, is that you decided to stop the car when and where you did, pulling up before you reached him, in order to give Joanne Dennehy the advantage of surprising her victim by  attacking  him  from  behind.  Whether  you  actually  uttered  the  words  “Will  he do?”, as Mark Lloyd told the jury, is less important. The fact is that you initiated the opportunity for the attack.   You, Joanne Dennehy, claim that you were under the influence of alcohol when you carried  out  this  attack  and  that  you  feel  remorse  for  what  you  did.  You  had undoubtedly  been  drinking  whiskey  from  a  bottle  during  the  journey  that  day  but despite the expert’s back‐calculation of your possible alcohol level, I reject entirely any suggestion that you were so inebriated that you were unaware of what you were doing or that you were disinhibited by the alcohol you had consumed. Only a minute or so before the first attack you and Mark Lloyd went into the Green Lane store, as shown on the CCTV. You appear to have been in high spirits and, from the way you were behaving towards the young woman behind the counter, you were possibly in a state of euphoria at what was in prospect, but there was no indication at all that you were grossly affected by drink.  Robin Bereza was 63 years old at the time, a retired fireman who had kept himself fit.  That  afternoon  he  had  chosen  to  walk  his  dog  rather  than  go  jogging.  You attacked him from behind, taking him completely unawares. You stabbed him first in the back then a second time in the right upper arm. When he turned to face you and asked what on earth you were doing you told him “I want to hurt you, I am going to fucking kill you”. He tried to fight you off, kicking out at you. You pursued him into     11the road, continuing  the attack, but eventually you did desist, probably because of the  arrival  of  another  car  at  the  scene  waiting  to  turn  into  a  side  road.  You,  Gary Stretch,  had driven the car slowly behind Joanne Dennehy and beckoned to her to get back into the car. You did and said nothing to show any disapproval or surprise at any  stage  at  what  she  was  doing.  I  accept  the  evidence  of  Mark  Lloyd  that  you exercised  some  degree  of  physical  restraint  over  him,  for  otherwise  I  am  sure  he would have got out of the car and distanced himself from what was going on. You Joanne Dennehy calmly got into the car, looking across and smiling at the driver of the other car waiting to turn right at the junction where this was taking place.   Although you managed to inflict only two stab wounds to Robin Bereza you caused him potentially fatal injuries. The deep wound to his back penetrated the chest wall causing a haemo‐pneumothorax as well as bruising the lung and fracturing a rib. Had the blood and air not been promptly drained from his chest cavity by expert medical treatment, his life would have been in danger. The other stab wound shattered the shoulder blade and fractured the bone in the upper arm. It was only by pure chance that  the  nerves  in  the  arm  were  not  damaged  irreparably  with  a  drastic  loss  of function.  The  attack  has  had  a  profound  effect  on  him  emotionally  and psychologically, and I shall return to this.   You, Joanne Dennehy, were not satisfied with the outcome of this first attack. You had  not  succeeded  in  your  objective  of  killing  another  man.  You  required  Gary Stretch to find you another victim and you, Gary Stretch, were happy to oblige her.   It was no coincidence that the second victim was another man walking his dog. Using your local knowledge you, Gary Stretch, drove to a cul‐de‐sac adjacent to a path well used by dog walkers.   As you told the police in interview, it was close to where your grandmother used to live. This time your victim was a 56 year old man, John Rogers who  lived  nearby  and  who  was  taking  his  dog  for  a  walk.  He  had  only  gone  a  few yards down the path when you attacked him from behind, stabbing him in the back. When he turned round you stabbed him repeatedly. You pushed him backwards for several yards, stabbing him all the time. When he fell over you continued to stab him to  the  front  and  to  the  back.  It  was  a  relentless  and  frenzied  attack  with  only  one    12purpose, to kill him. You left him for dead, picked up his dog, and left the scene. As he lay there helpless he thought he was dying. You accept that you thought you had killed him. That is what you told the police officer who arrested you a few minutes later.   You  stabbed  John  Rogers  more  than  30  times.  He  had  deep  wounds  to  his  chest, abdomen  and  back.  Both  lungs  had  collapsed.   His   bowel  was  perforated  and exposed.  Had  he  not  received  the  most  expert  and  prompt  medical  treatment  he would  have  died  from  these  injuries.  So  severe  was  the  force  of  the  stab  wounds that nine ribs were fractured. He also received wounds to his hands and arms which could  have  resulted  in  irreparable  nerve  damage.  He  too  has  suffered  grievous emotional and psychological harm, to which I shall return.      The  death  and  destruction  for  which  you  are  responsible,  Joanne  Dennehy,  has caused untold distress to the families and friends of the men you murdered and to the  victims  who  survived  and  their  families.  Many  of  those  affected  are  in  court today.  I have read and taken into account the victim personal statements from John Chapman’s brother‐in‐law, from Kevin Lee’s widow, and from Robin Bereza and John Rogers.  The  cruel  and  aggravated  circumstances  of  Kevin  Lee’s  death  in  particular have been very hard indeed for his loved ones to bear. They are here in court as a tribute  to  his  memory  and  to  see  justice  done.  You  Joanne,  Dennehy,  described yourself  to  Kevin  Lee  as  a  monster  for  what  you  had  done  in  the  past.  Kevin  Lee’s widow describes you as a monster who has taken and ruined her family’s lives. Robin Bereza speaks of his inability to grasp the reality that anyone could be so evil as to attack  someone  in  this  way  for  no  reason,  someone  you  had  never  met.  The experience  has  totally  shaken  his  confidence  and  turned  a  robust  former  fireman into  a  nervous  shadow  of  his  former  self.  The  lives  of  his  wife  and  family  have likewise been turned upside down and it is only with their love and support that he has been able to come to terms at all with the enormity of this experience.   John Rogers acknowledges that he owes his life to those who came to his assistance so  promptly  and  the  doctors  who  treated  him  so  expertly.  He  continues  to     13experience the  physical  consequences  of  the  attack.  For  example  he no  longer  has the dexterity to play the guitar, and he is a keen musician.  The psychological trauma has been just as devastating, and perhaps even greater. Only through the love and devotion of his wife has he been able to get through the ordeal at all.  Having  set  out  the  factual  basis  on  which  I  pass  sentence, I  now  deal  with  each  of you in turn.  Joanne Dennehy  First  you,  Joanne  Dennehy.  For  murder  there is  only  one  sentence, life imprisonment. But I am required to determine the minimum term you must serve. Parliament has laid down different starting points for the minimum term, depending upon the seriousness and circumstances of the case. In your case only two starting points  could  conceivably  be  appropriate,  either  a  whole  life  order  or  a  term  of  30 years.  If  the  latter,  the  gravity  of  your  offending  is  such  that  the  minimum  term would have to be very substantially in excess of 30 years.   The  issue  in  your  case,  therefore,  is  whether  or  not  there  should  be  a  whole  life order.  Any  question  as  to  the  lawfulness  of  such  a  sentence  has  been  dispelled  by the recent judgment of the Court of Appeal in the case of McLoughlin [2014] EWCA Crim  188.  My  duty  is  to  apply  the  provisions  of  paragraph  4  of  schedule  21  to  the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and to consider whether the seriousness of the offence (or the  combination  of  the  offence  and  one  or  more  offences  associated  with  it)  is exceptionally  high.  If  the  seriousness  is  exceptionally  high, the  appropriate  starting point is a whole life order. Paragraph 4(2) provides that cases that would normally fall  within  this  category  include  the  murder  of  two  or  more  persons  where  each murder involves a substantial degree of premeditation or planning, or the abduction of the victim, or sexual or sadistic conduct.   For the reasons I have already explained, I am quite sure that each of these three murders did involve a substantial degree of premeditation or planning. I am sure on the  evidence  that  you  lured  your  first  victim  Lukasz  Slaboszewski  to  11  Rolleston 14     Garth  specifically  in  order  to  kill  him.  I  am  quite  sure  on  all  the  evidence  that  you murdered  John  Chapman  not  on  the  spur  of  the  moment  because  he  had  been watching you in the bath but because by then you had got a taste for murder and, as you had told him, you were prepared to do whatever it would take to get him out of the house. I am quite sure that you lured Kevin Lee to 11 Rolleston Garth that Friday specifically  in  order  to  kill  him.  I  am  also  quite  sure  that  his  was  a  murder  which involved sexual and sadistic conduct on your part. It is true that there is no medical evidence at post mortem of sexual interference, but the whole circumstances of the killing bear out what he told his friend he was expecting, namely that you were going to dress him up and rape him. You admitted as much to Georgina Page. The way in which his body was dumped was part of the playing out of your sexual and sadistic motivation.    Quite  apart  from  meeting  the  threshold  of  seriousness  in  the  examples  given  in paragraph  4,  there  were  other  aggravating  features  to  these  three  murders.  First, each of them involved stabbing with a knife or knives that you took to the scene for that very purpose, even if only within the same building. Second, having murdered Lukasz Slaboszewski and having put his body in a wheelie bin, you made a point of inviting a 14 year old girl to come to 11 Rolleston Garth specifically to show her the body in the bin. Third, John Chapman, although not physically disabled, was to your knowledge  a  particularly  vulnerable  victim  on  account  of  his  alcoholism  and  you exploited that vulnerability. Fourth, you went to great lengths to dump each of the three bodies in a remote area where you hoped it would not be found. Fifth, having committed  these  murders  and  dumped  the  bodies,  and  knowing  that  you  were wanted  by  the  police,  you  attempted  to  murder  and  very  nearly  succeeded  in murdering  two  more  men,  selected  at  random,  by  stabbing  them  repeatedly. Although  there  are  separate  counts  which  cover  the  dumping  of  the  bodies  and these  two  attempted  murders,  the  overall  criminality  of  your  conduct  in  this  case must be reflected in the minimum term you are required to serve.  The starting point for your minimum term must therefore be a whole life order rather than 30 years.  Your counsel submits that a whole life order is not necessary in your case because the minimum term would in any event be so long.  15     In  addition  to  the  most  recent  decision  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  to  which  I  have referred, I have also considered carefully the guidance in this area given by the Court of Appeal in the case of Oakes [2013] 2 Cr App R 22. In particular I bear in mind that a whole life order should be imposed only where the seriousness of the offending is so exceptionally high that just punishment requires the offender to be kept in prison for the rest of his or her life. I am required to consider all the material facts before concluding that a very lengthy finite term will be not be sufficiently severe. I bear in mind that a whole life order is reserved for the few exceptionally serious offences in which, after reflecting on all the features of aggravation and mitigation, the court is satisfied that the element of just punishment and retribution requires the imposition of a whole life order. I also remind myself that I am setting the penal element of the sentence only. I am not concerned with risk to the public on release. That is a matter solely for the parole board or, very exceptionally, for the Secretary of State.  I have considered your criminal record. You are now 31 years of age. You have been in and out of prison in recent years serving short sentences, mainly for offences of dishonesty, although I note that in 2012 you were convicted of possessing a bladed article in a public place, razor blades, and later in the year you received a community order  for  an  offence  of  assault  occasioning  actual  bodily  harm.  I  have  read  the psychiatric report on you from Dr Farnham, dated 26th October 2013. I note that his assessment  is  that  you  suffer  from  a  severe  emotionally  unstable  personality disorder, and from an antisocial personality disorder. In his opinion you also suffer from paraphilia sadomasochism, a disorder of preference for sexual activity involving the infliction of pain or humiliation or bondage. It is Dr Farnham’s assessment that you suffer from a psychopathic disorder, that is a personality disorder characterised by superficial charm, callous disregard for others, pathological lying and a diminished capacity for remorse.   You have not sought to put forward any partial defence to murder based upon your psychiatric  condition.  You  very  strongly  declined  the  opportunity  to  do  so  by  the firmness  of  your  guilty  pleas  to  all  counts  on  the  indictment  when  you  were  first 16arraigned on 18th November last year. Your counsel accepted in mitigation that you do  not  have  the  normal  range  of  emotions  and  you  do  not  form  personal attachments.  Others  end  up  suffering  because  of  your  personality  and  that  risk  is removed by your being in custody. I do not consider that your personality disorders or psychiatric condition afford any mitigation in this case.   You  have  shown  no  genuine  remorse.  Quite  the  reverse.  In  the  letter  you  have written  to me  you  say in  terms  that  you  do  not  feel  any remorse  for  the  murders, and to claim otherwise would be a lie. You claim in that letter, and this formed part of  your  counsel’s  mitigation,  that  you  do  feel  remorse  for  the  attempted  murders. You say that you are ashamed of the brutality and fear you heaped upon those two victims and that the attacks will always be a great source of regret. The only reason you  can  offer  for  the  attempted  murders  is  “drunken  cruelty  plain  and  simple, compelled  by  my  lack  of  respect  for  human  life”.  As  I  have  already  made  clear,  I reject  your protestations  of  remorse  for  these attempted murders.  I  note  that  you told the psychiatrist that you killed to see how you would feel, “to see if I was as cold as I thought I was. Then it got moreish and I got a taste for it.” It is very significant, in my judgement, that from a single stab wound to the heart to kill your first victim you progressed  by  the  end  to  the  frenzied  attack  on  John  Rogers  when  you  so  nearly killed him, stabbing him more than 30 times. You told the psychiatrist you saw the killings as a kind of fetish and that you were sadistic.    I  have  considered  very  carefully  all  the  circumstances  of  this  case,  and  all  the features  of  aggravation  and  mitigation,  including  your  guilty  pleas.  I  am  quite satisfied  that  the  seriousness  of  these  murders  is  exceptionally  high  and  that  the element  of  just  punishment  and  retribution  requires  the  imposition  of  a  whole  life order. Even if, contrary to my conclusion, any of the three murders did not involve a substantial  degree  of  premeditation  or  planning,  the  overall  circumstances  of  the three murders, taken in combination with the attempted murders and the dumping of the bodies, plainly makes this a case of exceptionally high seriousness and one of the rare cases which requires a whole life order.     17 Having  regard  to  the  Sentencing  Council  guideline  for  attempted  murder,  I  am satisfied  that  each  of  these  attempted  murders,  if  they  stood  alone,  falls  into  the highest  category  in  level  1,  where  the  sentencing  range  after  a  trial  is  27‐35  years custody  and  the  starting  point  30  years.  There  must  be  life  sentences  for  the attempted murders. Had the offences of preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body  stood  alone,  the  appropriate  total  sentence  for  those  three  offences,  after  a trial,  would in  your  case  have  been at  least  16  years  imprisonment,  but  you  did  at least  plead  guilty,  for  which  you  are  entitled  to  credit  although  it  makes  no difference overall.  Joanne  Dennehy  for  these  three  cruel  and  brutal  murders  I  sentence  you  to  life imprisonment  and  the  term  you  will  serve  is  a  whole  life  order.  That  reflects  the seriousness not only of the three murders but also the two attempted murders and the three offences of preventing the lawful burial of the bodies of your three victims. For  the  two  attempted  murders,  there  will  be  concurrent  sentences  of  life imprisonment. For each of the offences of preventing burial, there will be concurrent sentences of 12 years imprisonment.  Gary Stretch  I  deal  with  you  next,  Gary  Stretch.  I  have  to  sentence  you  for  three  offences  of preventing  the  lawful  and  decent  burial  of  the  bodies  of  the  three  men  who  had been murdered, and for two offences of attempted murder. They are all very serious offences indeed, for which a very lengthy sentence of imprisonment is inevitable.  I  consider  first  the  three  counts  of  preventing  lawful  and  decent  burial.  It  is  a common law offence for which there is no maximum penalty. These were offences at  the  very  top  of  the  scale  of  seriousness.  I  have  been  referred  to  a  number  of authorities. In particular I have been assisted by the guidance of the Court of Appeal in the case of Godward [1998] 1 Cr App R (S) 385. This is an offence which can vary enormously  in  its  seriousness.  The  most  important  factor  is  the  intention  of  the offender. If the intention was to obstruct the course of justice by concealing a body, 18     so  as  to  make  it  difficult  or  impossible  to  bring  home  a  charge  against  the  person responsible  for  the  death,  then  a  sentence  at  the  top  of  the  appropriate  scale  is required.  That  is  plainly  the  position  here.  The  case  of  Skinner,  referred  to  in Godward, tends to suggest that any of these three offences on its own would have merited a sentence of at least 7 ½ years imprisonment after a trial.   Although  Joanne  Dennehy  initiated  these  offences,  you  played  a  leading  role  in selecting  the  sites  where  these  three  bodies  were  dumped.  In  particular  you  had lived near Thorney Dyke and boasted to Georgina Page that no one would find the bodies. Just how close you came to achieving that objective is demonstrated by the fact that the farmer who found the two bodies in the ditch at Thorney Dyke on 3rd April  had  for  several  days  been  working  in  that  area  of  his  land  without  spotting them. I am quite sure that you carried out reconnaissance of the outlying rural areas around  Peterborough  to  find  suitable  places  to  dump  the  bodies.  You  helped  to clean up the scenes of the murders. You helped to load the bodies into the car. You drove  the  car  to  the  scene.  As  I  have  already  made  clear,  I  reject  entirely  any suggestion  that  you  were  in  fear  of  Joanne  Dennehy.  On  the  contrary,  you  were revelling  in  helping  her  and  in  the  publicity  of  being  described  as  “Britian’s  most wanted”.  You  were  luxuriating  in  the  notoriety  which  you  enjoyed  through  your association  with  Joanne  Dennehy  and  her  crimes.  Taking  account  of  totality,  and passing concurrent sentences to reflect the overall criminality of the three offences, the overall sentence for these three counts of preventing the burial of the bodies, if the offences stood alone, would be 15 years imprisonment.   I turn to the two attempted murders. For the reasons I have already explained, on the facts of this case there is little difference between the alternative mental states which the jury were required to consider. Joanne Dennehy had to your knowledge already  murdered  three  men.  She  was  talking  that  day  about  wanting  her  fun  and doing  more.  It  was  therefore  obvious  to  you  that  if  and  when  she  found  another victim  she  was  bound  to  try  to  kill  him.  For  that  reason  there  is  precious  little difference between a shared intention to kill on the one hand and a realisation that there was a real risk she would kill, with the intent to kill, on the other. I am quite    19satisfied  that  you  knew  perfectly  well  that  when  the  opportunity  arose  she  would attempt to kill again.   You  did  not  wield  the  knife,  but  you  played  a  crucial  part  in  facilitating  these  two dreadful attempted murders. As I have already set out, you stopped the car where and when you did specifically so that she could get out and attack Robin Bereza from behind,  catching  him  unawares.  In  that  sense  you  both  assisted  and  encouraged Joanne Dennehy to commit the offence, fully believing and expecting that she would stab  her  victim  to  death.  You  knew  there  were  no  half  measures  with  Joanne Dennehy.  You  said  or  did  nothing  to  stop  her.  Quite  the  opposite.  You  sat  and watched what she was doing, and beckoned her back to the car when the time was right.  For  the  reasons  I  have  already  explained,  I  am  quite  sure  as  well  that  you exercised some physical restraint on Mark Lloyd for a short time at least in order to stop him leaving the car and raising the alarm.   When Joanne Dennehy made it clear that she wanted a second victim you drove her to a spot where you knew, from your local knowledge of Hereford, that dog walkers were to be found. It was no coincidence that John Rogers, walking his dog, was the next  victim.  Again,  you  assisted  and  encouraged  Joanne  Dennehy  to  commit  that second  and  very  nearly  fatal  attack,  knowing  perfectly  well  that  murder  was  what she intended. Had either of these two victims died, you would have been facing a life sentence for murder. The starting point for your minimum term for one such offence of murder would have been 25 years, and if both men had died, the starting point would have been at least 30 years.  Both  victims  survived,  but  these  two  attempted  murders  are  still  offences  of  the utmost  seriousness,  and  at  the  very  top  of  the  scale  under  the  Sentencing  Council guideline. Your counsel submits that your culpability was markedly less than Joanne Dennehy’s  and  that  this  means  that  these  were,  in  your  case,  at  most  level  2 offences. I disagree. In my judgment they are plainly level 1 offences, that is to say offences of a kind which would attract a starting point of 30 years for the minimum term had the charge been murder. That is equivalent to a determinate sentence of     2060  years.   In   both  cases,  for  the  reasons  I  have  explained,  the  victim  has  suffered serious and long term physical and psychological harm. That means that under the guideline  the  starting  for  these  two  attempted  murders  would  be  a  determinate sentence of 30 years imprisonment, with a sentencing range of 27 to 35 years. That would  be  the  appropriate  level  of  sentence  for  someone  with  no  previous convictions whatsoever.   You have an appalling criminal record, albeit mainly for offences of dishonesty. That record,  however,  includes  many convictions  for  dwelling  house  burglary  where  the potential  for  confrontation  with  a  householder  is  always  a  risk.  You  also  have  a conviction for robbery as a young man, for which you received a custodial sentence of 5 years. That, I am told, arose in the course of a house burglary. More recently in 2000  you  were  sentenced  to  a  total  of  4  years  imprisonment  for  handling  stolen goods.  When  you  breached  your  licence  following  release  from  that  sentence  you received  a  consecutive  sentence  of  2  years  for  a  dwelling  house  burglary.  In  2008 you  received  a  total  sentence  of  15  months  imprisonment  for  harassment  of  your former partner, threatening via a third party to kill her. When she was due to give evidence you intimidated her to try to prevent her giving evidence. As a result there is an indefinite restraining order in force against you. These offences show a violent, aggressive and impulsive side to your character which you try to hide by portraying yourself as a harmless failed burglar who is always caught because of his enormous  Your  counsel  has  submitted  that  your  sentence  for  these  two  attempted  murders should be significantly shorter  because you were only a secondary party and not  a principal  offender.  It  is  well  established  on  the  authorities  that  for  murder  the starting  points  in  schedule  21  apply  equally  to  secondary  parties  as  to  principals, although  the  starting  point  may  well  have  to  be  adjusted  to  reflect  a  secondary party’s  lesser  culpability  on  the  facts  of  the  particular  case:  see  Attorney  General’s Reference (No.24 of 2008) [2009] 2 Cr App R (S) 41. The same reasoning applies to the  situation  here.  I  accept  that  your  culpability  was  substantially  less  than  that  of Joanne Dennehy in these offences, but it was still very great. If the two attempted 21  size.   murders  stood  alone  the  appropriate  total  sentence  for  you  for  those  offences would be 27 years.   The  offences  you  committed  in  Hereford  amounted  to  entirely  distinct  criminality from  the  offences  you  committed  in  Peterborough.  Consecutive  sentences  are therefore required as between the two sets of offences. On what I have indicated so far, that would make a total of 42 years. Because the offences are so distinct and so serious,  and  because  I  have  not  treated  either  set  of  offences  as  aggravating  the seriousness of the other, only a modest further reduction for totality is appropriate. I therefore  conclude  that  if  a  determinate  sentence  were  the  appropriate  course  to follow  in  your  case,  these  offences  together  would  merit  a  total  determinate sentence of 38 years, made up of 13 years concurrent for each of the prevention of burial  offences  and  25  years  concurrent  for  each  of  the  attempted  murders.  If  38 years were your sentence, you would serve 19 years before release on licence.  However, I have to consider whether a determinate sentence is appropriate at all or whether it is necessary to pass a sentence of life imprisonment or, alternatively, an extended sentence of imprisonment.      Because you have been convicted of offences of attempted murder I am required by law  to  consider  whether  you  are  a  “dangerous”  offender,  in  other  words  whether there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by you of further specified offences, which for practical purposes means serious  harm  from  any  significant  offence  of  violence.  In  making  that  assessment  I must  take  into  account  all  information  available  to  me  about  you  and  about  the nature  and  circumstances  of  these  offences  of  attempted  murder  and  the  other offences of which you have been convicted, including information about any pattern of behaviour of which any of those offences forms part.  I  bear  in  mind  that  these  attempted  murders  are  offences  at  the  very  top  of  the range  of  seriousness.  You  were  convicted  as  a  secondary  party,  not  as  a  principal, but  these  offences  demonstrate  your  willingness  to  involve  yourself  in  the  most      22serious  violence.  Second,  I  bear  in  mind  that  likewise  the  offences  of  preventing burial were of the most serious kind, committed in order to interfere with the course of  justice.  They  did  not  involve  any  violence  but  they  demonstrate  a willingness  to assist a triple murderer to evade justice. Third, you have a previous conviction for a serious offence of robbery, albeit a very long time ago, and a more recent conviction for  harassing  your  ex‐partner  by  indirectly  threatening  to  kill  her,  compounded  by intimidating  her,  or  attempting  to  intimidate  her,  into  not  giving  evidence  against you.  Fourth,  you  are  an  inveterate  house  burglar,  where  the  risk  of  conflict  with  a householder  is  always  present.  Fifth  you  threatened  Georgina  Page  with  violence, albeit  indirectly,  if  she  went  to  the  police.  That  was  not  just  for  bravado  because Joanne  Dennehy  was  present.  Sixth  you  were  prepared  to  arm  yourself  with  a handgun whilst you were on the run from the police, although you disposed of the gun  without  using  it,  and  I  accept  there  is  no  other  evidence  you  have  ever possessed or used a firearm.  Your counsel rightly urges upon me the most powerful point in mitigation against the imposition  of  a  sentence  based  on  dangerousness,  namely  the  fact  you  committed these  offences  in  the  thrall  of  Joanne  Dennehy.  That  opportunity  will  never  arise again. I have considered carefully the guidance of the Court of Appeal in the recent decision in Saunders [2013] EWCA Crim 1027, and the circumstances in which a life sentence  may  be  appropriate  and  necessary  for  its  “denunciatory”  value  reflecting public  abhorrence  of  the  offence,  and  where  the  notional  determinate  sentence would be very long indeed, as here, measured in very many years. However, I would first have to be satisfied that there is a significant risk that you would commit further offences of violence if at large and a significant risk of serious harm to members of the public as a result.   I have considered very carefully all the submissions, both written and oral, made so powerfully  by  your  counsel,  but  despite  those  submissions,  I  have  no  hesitation  in reaching the conclusion that there is a significant risk of serious harm to members of the  public  from  the  commission  by  you  of  further  specified  offences.  I  accept  that these offences of attempted murder in which you played a full part arose from the    23special  circumstances  of  your  association  with  Joanne  Dennehy.  However,  having seen  the  way  she  attacked  the  first  victim,  you  encouraged  her  to  attack  again, knowing  that  she  was  likely  to  kill.  That  persistence  on  your  part,  as  well  as  hers, demonstrates all too clearly your potential for causing serious harm to the public in the  future,  particularly  in  the  light  of  the  other  factors  I  have  just  identified.  I therefore conclude that the threshold of dangerousness is clearly met.  That  being  so,  the  next  question,  under  s225(2)  of  the  2003  Act  is  whether  the offences are together so serious as to justify a sentence of life imprisonment. In my view  they  are.  A  very  long  determinate  sentence  would  not  in  my  judgment  be sufficient  to  protect  the  public.  Nor  would  an  extended  sentence  be  appropriate bearing in mind the very long custodial term which would dwarf even the maximum extension  period  of  5  years.  I  bear  firmly  in  mind  that  a  sentence  of  life imprisonment must always be a last resort. But in my judgment, this is a case where a life sentence is required in order to reflect public abhorrence of these offences of attempted  murder  committed  jointly  whilst  you  were  seeking  to  evade  arrest  for helping to dispose of the bodies of three men already murdered by Joanne Dennehy.   As the Court of Appeal made clear in Saunders, it remains open to the court to pass a  discretionary  life  sentence  even  where  the  pre‐conditions  for  a  sentence  under section 225 of the Act are not met. Had that been the position in your case (which I stress  it  is  not),  I  would  in  any  event  have  passed  a  discretionary  life  sentence  on that  alternative  basis,  having  regard  to  the  overriding  need  to  protect  the  public from you indefinitely.  Gary  Stretch,  for  each  of  the  offences  of  attempted  murder  the  sentence  is  life imprisonment. You will serve a minimum term of 19 years, that being one half of the determinate sentence which would otherwise have been appropriate. That term of 19  years  reflects  the  criminality  not  only  of  the  attempted  murders  but  also  the three  offences  of  preventing  burial.  For  those  offences  there  will  be  concurrent terms of 15 years imprisonment. You will receive credit against the term of 19 years for the time you have already spent on remand which, by my calculation, is 332 days.     24The  effect  of  this  sentence  is  that  you  will  serve  19  years  in  prison  before  you  are even  eligible  to  be  considered  for  parole.  It  will  then  be  a  matter  for  the  parole board to decide if and when it is safe to release you, and  if you are released you will remain on licence for the rest of your life.       Leslie Layton  I deal with you next Leslie Layton. I have to sentence you for preventing the lawful and decent burial of the bodies of two of the men Joanne Dennehy had murdered. I also have to sentence you for perverting the course of justice by lying to the police when they were trying to find what had become of John Chapman, one of the men who  was  murdered.   For   the  reasons  I  have  already  explained,  these  offences  of preventing  burial  are  at  the  very  top  of  the  range  of  seriousness.  Had  they  stood alone,  each  individually  would  have  merited  a  sentence  of  7½  years  or  more.  You were actively involved in dumping these two bodies, but your involvement spanned a single day, Friday 29th March. I am satisfied that you played a subordinate role to Gary Stretch and Joanne Dennehy, although you were a perfectly willing participant.  It  is  an  aggravating  feature  of  the  offences  that  you  had  already  taken  that photograph of John Chapman’s dead body on your mobile phone. That casts a flood of  light  on  your  attitude  towards  the  fate  of  your  housemate  and  on  your  lack  of concern  or  respect  for  human  life  and  for  the  decency  and  dignity  of  a  body  after death.  You  had  every  opportunity  to  distance  yourself  from  what  you  were  being asked to do but chose to go along with it. You assisted physically with the removal of John Chapman’s body from the house. You travelled with each of the bodies to the separate sites where they were dumped. You were prominent in setting fire to and destroying Kevin Lee’s vehicle, as a further way of preventing the circumstances of his death being discovered and hence preventing his lawful and decent burial.  Yours was also a serious offence of perverting the course of justice. You lied to the police repeatedly in what you knew to be a murder investigation. You did so to cover your  own  tracks  and  to  protect  Gary  Stretch  and  Joanne  Dennehy.  You  had  no 25reason  to  be  in  fear  of  them  because  they  were  far  away  in  East  Anglia  when  the police  came  to  see  you,  as  you  well  knew.  Whether  they  would  have  been apprehended  sooner  had  you  told  the  police  the  truth,  we  shall  never  know.  It  is certainly possible they could have been arrested before committing the offences in Hereford. That is an illustration of the potential seriousness of your offence.   You are now 37 years of age. You have previous convictions for offences involving vehicles and for dishonesty but you had never been to prison before. These offences are  wholly outside your normal league. You were caught up in the excitement and fascination of these appalling murders committed in one case quite literally on your doorstep by a woman who undoubtedly exercised some psychological influence over you and other men with whom she came into contact, including her victims. But that does not excuse what you did. Nor do you have the mitigation of guilty pleas.  I have had regard to the guidance in the authorities to which I have been referred and in particular Tunney [2007] 1 Cr App (S) 91 and Gonsalves [2008] 1 Cr App (S) 40, both  of  which  involved  perverting  the  course  of  justice  in  homicide  cases.  They emphasise the need to consider three factors in particular. First, the seriousness of the substantive offence. Here it was murder. It could not be more serious. Second, the  persistence  of  the  offender’s  conduct.  Here  you  persisted  in  these  false statements over a period of two days, although the most extensive lies were told on the afternoon of Monday 1st April. Third, the effect of what you did on the course of justice itself. Here your attempt was unsuccessful in the sense that the police soon discovered the truth of what had happened, and John Chapman’s body was in any event discovered, fortuitously, two days later.  There must plainly be a consecutive sentence for the offence of perverting the course of justice because it involved quite separate and distinct criminality from the two offences of preventing burial.      Leslie  Layton.  Were  it  not  for  the  fact  that  I  must  bear  in  mind  the  totality  of  the sentence I am passing upon you, the individual sentences would have been longer. For  the  two  offences  of  preventing  the  lawful  and  decent  burial  of  bodies  you  will serve concurrent sentences of 10 years imprisonment. For the offence of perverting     26the course of justice you will serve a consecutive sentence of 4 years imprisonment. So  your  total  sentence  is  14  years  imprisonment.  You  will  serve  one  half  of  that sentence in prison and upon release you will be on licence for the remainder of the sentence  and  liable  to  recall  if  you  commit  any  further  offence  or  breach  your licence.   Robert Moore        I deal finally with you, Robert Moore.  You had the good sense to plead guilty to the two counts you faced, although your guilty pleas did not come at the first reasonable opportunity so you cannot expect full credit. It is clear to me from the pre‐sentence report that you do not fully understand even now just how serious your conduct was in giving shelter to Joanne Dennehy and Gary Stretch for two nights when you knew they were wanted by the police for the most serious of offences.  You  are  56  years  of  age  and  a  man  with  no  previous  convictions  whatsoever.  I  am prepared  to  accept  that  you  came  under  the  spell  of  Joanne  Dennehy  and  were flattered  by  her  attention.  You  must  have  known  the  sort  of  woman  you  were getting involved with when you were made aware that the body of one her victims was  in  a  wheelie  bin  at  her  address  close  to  your  home.  You  admitted  to  the probation officer that you knew that. You kept in close touch with Joanne Dennehy and Gary Stretch by phone in what might be described as a fawning manner, texting that you had food waiting for them. When Joanne Dennehy and Gary Stretch went on the run in East Anglia you texted them that the police were after them and you wished them luck. They returned to your home again that night.  When  you  were  interviewed  by  the  police  you  repeatedly  lied  about  your involvement  in  helping  Joanne  Dennehy  and  Gary  Stretch.  Had  you  not  provided them  with  shelter  for  those  two  nights  and  had  you  instead  done  your  duty  as  a citizen  by  telling  the  police  straightaway  what  you  knew,  it  is  possible  that  they would  have  been  arrested  earlier,  and  before  the  offences  In  Hereford  were committed.  Again,  we  shall  never  know  but  it  illustrates  the  seriousness  and  the potential consequences of what you did.  27         The  maximum  sentence  for  the  offences  to  which  you  have  pleaded  guilty  is  10 years imprisonment. I have had regard to the guidance in the authorities in this area, notably R v Elfes [2006] EWCA Crim 2799 and Attorney General’s Ref (No:16 of 2009) [2009] EWCA Crim 2439. In both those cases, however, the duration and value of the assistance  was  greater  than  in  your  case.  I  also  take  into  account  your  good character and the health issues which are revealed in the pre‐sentence report. I have had  the  opportunity  to  observe  you  in  the  dock  during  the  sentencing  hearing  at Cambridge  two  weeks  ago  as  well  as  in  the  dock  here  today.  I  accept  that  you  are genuinely remorseful. Had you been convicted of these two offences after a trial, the sentence would have been  four  years  imprisonment.  As  it  is  you  pleaded  guilty  at  a  late  stage,  but  that took courage. You will receive credit of one‐quarter for those pleas.  Robert  Moore.  For  each  of  these  offences  you  will  serve  a  sentence  of  3  years imprisonment concurrent. That means you will released when you have served one half of the sentence and you will remain on licence for the rest of the sentence.   28
