Bristol Crown Court      28 November 2013                                                                              R   ‐v‐James    and  Norley    Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Simon    The circumstances of the murder of Bijan Ebrahimi (and the subsequent burning of his body)  are deeply shocking.    Ben Ebrahimi (as he was known locally) was a single man of Iranian origin, who lived alone,   and kept to himself. It was partly because of this that some his neighbours came to view him  with suspicion. He had moved to this country in 2001; and had lived in a ground floor flat at   88 Capgrave Crescent for about 6 years. Among his neighbours were the two of you. You  (Lee James) lived at No.82 with your partner and 3 children; and you (Stephen Norley) lived  at  No.84.  Each  of  the  flats  had  doors  at  ground  level,  and  looked  out  onto  a  piece  of  communal open ground.    Witnesses speak of disputes between Mr Ebrahimi and some of his neighbours. One of the  complaints against him was that he took photographs or video films of people in the open   area outside the flats.   There  were accusations  that  he  was  filming  children.  He  explained  that  he  was  gathering   evidence about the anti‐social behaviour of some of these neighbours.    On Thursday 11 July (three days before he was murdered) You (James) were complaining   that he was spending too long watering the plants outside his flat, and using this as an   excuse to look at children. You entered his flat and threatened him. He called the police;    and you (in turn) spoke to a Police Community Support Officer, who happened to be in the   vicinity. You raised your complaints about him looking at your children, saying words to the   effect that, if the Police wouldn’t deal with it, you would; and that you were not scared of   being arrested or sent to prison. You were warned not to take matters into your own hands                                                                                                                                                                                                       1                        Two police officers arrived and made enquiries. They left to make some investigations back  at the police station and then returned to Capgrave Crescent. When they saw you, you were   highly aggressive. You told them that there was no point since they would not do anything   about it; and that you would protect your kids by making sure that he could not anything    like this again.    Two  witnesses  heard  you  threatening  to  kill  him.  You  (Norley)  were  seen  trying  to  calm   things down.                                                       Eventually the officers decided to arrest Mr Ebrahimi rather than you. It was said to be for   his own safety.     Some of the neighbours cheered when they saw him being led from his home in handcuffs.                                   In fact it is now clear that Mr Ebrahimi’s filming was directed at you (James) and not your  children.  He  told  the  officers  that  he  was  filming  you  because  you  were  drinking  cans  of  lager all the time and making a mess.                                                                              The fixed and removable memory recovered from his camera shows that, although children  were in shot, they were not the object of any special interest. The footage also shows you   (James) entering his flat and threatening him, until you were pulled away by your partner.    By  the  next  morning,  Friday  12  July,  the  police  were  satisfied  that  Mr  Ebrahimi  had  not  committed any offence. He was released and went home, having been given advice about   how his filming might be perceived. During the course of that evening he made several calls     to the police reporting the continuing hostility of his neighbours and seeking assistance.    I make it clear that the quality of decisions of the police (either in relation to the arrest of    Mr Ebrahimi, his release or the response for his requests for help) is not a matter for this    Court. I am concerned with your acts and your culpability for what occurred.                                                                                                                          In the early hours of Saturday 13 July, Mr Ebrahimi emailed the beat manager to say that he    was being called nasty things and that he did not feel safe staying in his home.    During the course of that afternoon, a number of people (which included the two of you)  assembled in the communal area outside the flats. By the late afternoon this group (fuelled   by  the  consumption  of  alcohol)  had  become  noisy,  and  were  making  aggressive  remarks   towards  Mr  Ebrahimi,  who  remained  in  his  flat  throughout  the  day.  These  remarks  (intended  to be  heard by  him)  were  similar to what had  been said  before:  that he  was a  paedophile.                                                                          2                                           They were as baseless then as they always had been.    At  some  stage  it  is  clear  you  (James)  decided  to  take  the  matter  further.  You  told  your   partner to go into the flat and you locked the front door.    It is still unclear how your victim came to be killed.    The  hanging  basket  and  the  tubs  outside  his  flat  were  later  found  to  have  been  recently   watered; and it seems he may have come out of his flat to water them when he thought it    was safe to do it.    The account that you gave to the police in a subsequent interview was that you were about  to go back into your flat when you saw him come out and walked over to him. You said you  told  him  to  stop  staring  at  your  children;  and  he  played  dumb,  and  then  said  something   about  one  of  his  daughter’s  dresses.  According  to  your  account,  you pushed  him,  and  he   then made a remark about nappies, at which point you pushed, punched and kicked him.                                                                                                                                                            I consider it extremely unlikely that he in fact said or did anything which might have roused    you  to  violence.  He  would  have  heard  you  and  others  shouting  abuse,  which  included   accusations that he was a paedophile, together with threats that he did not deserve to live.  What is very much more likely is that, affected as you were by alcohol, you misinterpreted  whatever he said; however, it is unnecessary to form a view about this, because it does not    affect the sentence.    You described to the police how when he went to the ground you continued to punch him  and to kick him.   At some point what was happening was noticed by his neighbours                                                           One of them heard a voice shouting angrily, twice: ‘I am going to kill you.                  Another  witness  saw  you  outside  in  the  communal  area,  repeatedly  stamping  on  your  victim’s head.                    You (Norley) were standing nearby. I accept that there is independent evidence that at one  point you intervened to stop James from delivering more punches to the head; and there is  no evidence that you were involved in the fatal assault.                                         3     However it is clear that you both set about burning the body. You (Norley) got hold of some  White Spirit; and the pair of you dragged his body out of the Communal area, onto a grassed    piece of ground on the edge of Whitmore Avenue.                                          There you set fire to the body, before running back to the flats, and taking steps to get rid of    the clothes you had been wearing, and the incriminating material which was on them.                                                                                                                                                               Paramedics arrived at 0136 on the morning of Sunday 14 July, the body of your victim was     still burning, and the fire had to be put out with a fire extinguisher.      The post mortem examination revealed multiple heavy blows to the face and head, which   may have led directly to his death, or may have caused him to die of asphyxia from inhaled    blood. It appears that his body was set alight after death.   When you returned to your flat, you (James) told your partner that you had taken care of   things. You were arrested soon after, charged with the murder of Mr Bijan Ebrahimi, and    pleaded guilty to the murder, effectively at the first opportunity.    You  (Norley)  did  not  answer  questions  during  your  police  interview;  but  you  too  pleaded   guilty to assisting an offender at what I treat as the first opportunity.    You (James) are 24; with a record for minor offences.     You  (Norley)  are  25  with  no  previous  convictions.  You  have  been  in  regular  employment,  and have been described as a devoted and attentive family man.   I  have  read  and  taken  into  account  the  statement  of  Bijan  Ebrahimi’s  sister  (Manizhah   Moores) made on behalf of his family and friends. It sets out some of the difficulties in his   life;  and  describes  the  deep  sense  of  loss  that  his  family  and  friends  have  endured  (and    continue to endure), as a result of his murder and the desecration of his body.    I have also listened and taken into account what has said on behalf of each of you behalf.    You will each pay the statutory charge.    Lee James   The  sentence  for  murder  is  prescribed  by  law:  I  therefore  sentence  you  to  a  term  of  life   imprisonment.   I  must  also  fix  the  minimum  term  which  you  must  serve  before  you  are  considered  for     release, by reference to schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003                                                                                                                                             4                           Before considering the aggravating and mitigating factors I take the starting point to be a  term of 15 years.    There are two aggravating factors (I do not regard your previous record as relevant to this    sentence).   First,  you  had  been  threatening  to  use  violence  in  the  days  before  you  murdered  Mr  Ebrahimi. Your persistent animosity and threats to kill him were noted by witnesses. I am  satisfied that this was a vigilante crime, with the element of bullying and victimisation that   this implies. You had decided (wrongly) that Mr Ebrahimi was paedophile and that this put   him  outside  the  law.  You  thought  that  you  were  entitled  to  take  the  law  into  your  own   hands (as the misleading expression has it). What you did had nothing to do with the law or  justice. The law provides that guilt is decided in a court with the protections of a fair trial;    and the law protects life. Yours was an act of murderous injustice.                                                                                                                              Secondly, (and this a statutory aggravating factor), there was the destruction of the body.  You told the police that you panicked and were not thinking straight. But the burning of the   body, so that the police officer who had seen him only 2 days before no longer recognised    him, was a gratuitously abusive act, and has (not surprisingly) added to the great distress of     his family.                                                     So far as mitigation is concerned there is one factor, but it is the most important factor: your   plea of guilty to the offence of murder, and the expression of your remorse.                           For this you are entitled to the maximum credit to which you are entitled: a reduction of   one sixth.                                             Taking all these matters into account I have decided that the minimum term that you must  serve before you are considered for release, is a term of 18 years, less the time you have   spent on remand. This does not mean that you will be released after this time. You will only   be released when the Parole Board conclude that it is safe to release you. If they decide to    release you, you will remain on licence for the rest of your life     Stephen Norley                                                      You  have  pleaded  guilty  to  an  offence  under  s.4(1)  of  the  Criminal  Law  Act,  assisting  an     offender.   You helped James drag the body away from the site of his murder; and you were involved in    setting fire to it. It was you fetched the White Spirit.                                           5            The  aggravating  factor  is  the  seriousness  of  the  offence  which  you  knew  Lee  James  had   committed.                     The  mitigating  factors  are  your  previous  excellent  character,  and  most  importantly,  your  plea of guilty.     Among the many references I have seen, is one from your employer. He has spoken of his  sense of sadness and shame that these crimes have brought on this City; but also describes    you as the most grounded, stable and honest person he has every employed.                                                           How you came to commit this crime seems to be a mystery to everyone who knows you,  and (it seems) to you.   The maximum sentence for this offence is a term of 10 years (since the maximum sentence   for the person you assisted is fixed by law)                                         In Att‐Gen’s Ref No 16 of 2009 (2009) EWCA Crim 2439 the Court of Appeal indicated that   there are 3 material matters for the sentencing court to consider: (1) the nature and the  extent of the criminality of the offender assisted; (2) the nature and extent of the assistance  provided, and (3) the extent that the interests of justice were damaged.                                                         So far as the last of these matters is concerned, the interests of justice were not significantly    damaged. The attempts to conceal the crime were futile; and I accept that this was a short‐   lived role and relatively unsophisticated assistance.                              However the burning of the body of a man, whom you knew had been murdered, makes    this a serious instance of this offence.                       In  my  view  the  appropriate  starting  point  for  this  offence  is  a  term  in  excess  of  6  years.   Taking into account the credit for the plea and other mitigation, the sentence will be a term   of 4 years.                                                You will serve half that time in prison, less any time on remand; and when you are released   you  will  remain  on  licence  for  the  remaining  period  of  the  sentence.  If  you  commit  any     further offence during that time you may be recalled to prison.                            6
