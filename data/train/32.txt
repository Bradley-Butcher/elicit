   IN THE PRESTON CROWN COURT  1ST FEBRUARY 2013 REGINA -V-FREDERICK GILLIARD       HIS HONOUR JUDGE ANTHONY RUSSELL QC, RECORDER OF PRESTON SENTENCING REMARKS OF On 9th July 2012 when your case was listed for trial you pleaded guilty to the unlawful killing of  your wife Josephine June Gilliard who was then aged 74 years.  You had been married to each other  for  over  50  years  and  you  lived  together  at  40  Links  Road,  Blackpool.  You  had  been charged  with  murder  but  the  prosecution  accepted  your  plea  of  guilty  to  manslaughter  on  the basis  of  diminished  responsibility.  This  assessment  was  based  upon  the  evidence  of  two psychiatrists  to  the  effect  that  at  the  time  of  the  killing  you  were  suffering  from  a  depressive episode.  For  reasons  I  need  not  go  into  there  has  been  an  unusually  long  delay  between  your pleading guilty and the sentence hearing today. You were the same age as your wife. On 5th February 2102 you made a 999 call.  When officers arrived at your home they found that your wife was lying on the floor next to the bed in the main  bedroom.   She  had  suffered  catastrophic  blunt  trauma  injuries  to  the  head  and  several  knife  wounds  to  the  body.   Despite  prolonged  attempts  by  paramedics  to  revive  her  she  was  pronounced dead at the scene. During the 999 call you said that you had just killed your wife and had smashed her head in then stabbed her.  You said that following a blazing row you had just lost it and smashed her quite a few times with a thing out of the garden then stabbed her with a carving knife.  In answer to a  direct  question  you  said  you  had  suffered  from  depression  but  the  tablets  you  had  been  given    didn’t work so you stopped taking them.  You said “Everything went today, I don’t know what  happened, I can’t remember flipping hitting her.”  In  the  main  bedroom  was  a  blood  smeared  garden  ornament.   On  top  of  the  body  was  a  long  carving  type  knife  with  a  21.5cm  (8  ½  inches)  blade.  Later  Post-mortem  examination  by  Dr  Armour revealed that June Galliard had suffered at least 10 blows to the head with considerable force  using  an  object  such  as  the  ornament.  Those  blows  caused  skull  fractures  and  other significant injury sufficient to have caused death.  However there were also multiple stab wounds   to the neck, chest and abdomen.   When the police arrived you were downstairs smoking a cigarette.  When you were arrested you  said words to the effect of “I should have killed myself” Following your arrest you were taken to hospital  for  treatment  of  a  cut  to  your  hand.  You  told  the  nurse  that  you  couldn’t  take  it  anymore, your wife was always putting you down; you had had a blazing row and you had just lost it so you went to the garden, got a gnome and smashed her with it.  You were very calm and  collected but at the end of your remarks you said “we’ve been married 54 years” and “I love that woman” and became tearful. This was a very brutal killing as the injuries and examination of the scene revealed. An intention  to  kill  at  the  time  was  clearly  established.  In  interviews  with  the  police  you  referred  to  your  relationship with your wife having got worse over the previous 12 months. The  careful  examination  of  you  by  3  psychiatrists  confirms  that  there  had  been  a  deteriorating relationship  with  your  wife  over  the  relatively  recent  past  and  that  you  were  suffering  from depression. However the balance of medical opinion is that treatment in a mental hospital under  the terms of a Hospital Order is not required. You have written a very moving letter to me which indicates a very genuine remorse and shows  your  concern  for  your  family  as  a  consequence  of  acts  which  it  is  clear  you  greatly  regret  and  which  would  not  have  occurred  but  for  the  situation  you  found  yourself  in  very  strongly influenced by your medical condition.        Page 2 of 3 The tragedy has affected all of your family and you greatly and inflicted emotional damage which can never be repaired. The fact that you have the support of your family is something for which they are to be commended.  In  deciding  the  appropriate  sentence  the  first  principle  is  that  whatever  the  mitigation,  this  offence can only be punished by the imposition of a sentence which results in loss of liberty. So there must be a sentence of imprisonment because no alternative sentence is available. This is not  a case for an indeterminate sentence. The length of the sentence must reflect the seriousness of the offence and the result, but that can be tempered by the fact that you are aged 76, you were 75  at the time of the offence, and you not only have no previous convictions of any kind but led a thoroughly decent life, serving in the Royal Air Force for many years, working hard, bringing up and caring for your family. I  have  considered  reported  cases  of  sentencing  for  diminished  responsibility,  many  of  which  result  in  a  medical  disposal  which  is  not  appropriate  for  you.  There  is  no  reported  case  which assists me.  Although the plea of guilty was entered on the day the case was listed for trial it is appropriate to give more credit than the minimum because the plea was notified shortly before the trial and this was a case in which it was appropriate to await the psychiatric reports before giving you advice on your plea. In those circumstances I shall reduce the sentence by one third to give credit for your plea of guilty.  Taking into account all the factors I have mentioned the sentence of the court for the offence of manslaughter is a sentence of 4 years’ imprisonment.             Page 3 of 3
