 MEHMET OZEN LINCOLN CROWN COURT 18 DECEMBER 2013 R -V- 1 SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE FLAUX  1.	  Mehmet  Ozen  you  have  been  convicted  of  the  murder  of  Darren  Harwood  and Charlotte Piccaver. By its verdict the jury has rejected your defences of self-defence and loss of control. What is clear from the evidence and, in particular the nature of the  wounds inflicted, is that this was a brutal attack on two young people who, at the time you attacked them, were unarmed.    2.	  At  about  4.40  in  the  morning  of  21  April  2013,  the  argument  between  you  and Keyleigh Wright about the rent money which had precipitated the incidents on 18 and  19 April flared up again. On the basis of the evidence of Ashley Gadbury, you came out of your bedroom when Keyleigh Wright came downstairs to the kitchen and you were shouting and arguing with her in the kitchen. I accept that when you went back  to  your  bedroom  she  followed  you  into  the  room  to  continue  the  argument  and  that she had the kitchen knife, not to kill you but to threaten you so you would return her £420. When you were both inside the room but close to the door, not as you suggested  in evidence on or near your bed, you wrested the knife from her, cutting the webbing between the thumb and forefinger of your left hand in the process. In the struggle you  stabbed her with the knife cutting her arm.   3.	  At  the  very  moment  you  were  struggling  with  Keyleigh  Wright,  Charlotte  Piccaver and  Darren  Harwood  came  into  the  room.  Seeing  what  was  going  on,  Darren Harwood  stepped  between  you  and  Keyleigh  to  protect  her  and  stop  the  argument between the two of you, acting as the peacemaker then, as he had earlier that night in  Boston. His terrible fate for trying to be the peacemaker is that, infuriated and almost certainly in revenge for what had happened two nights before, when he had stepped in to break up a fight between you and Charlotte as you were trying to push her down the  stairs,  you  stabbed  him  in  the  neck.  You  deliberately  targeted  one  of  the  most  vulnerable  parts  of  the  human  body,  intending  to  kill  him.  Almost  certainly  as  he  turned instinctively away from your attack you brutally stabbed him in the back.  He never had a chance to defend himself.      4.	  You  then  turned  your  fury  on  Charlotte  Piccaver.  Given  the  pandemonium  in  that  room,  she  was  understandably  shouting  at  you,  but  I  reject  any  suggestion  that  she,  any  more  than  Darren  Harwood,  posed  any  sort  of  physical  threat  to  you.  You attacked her in a temper and in revenge for her having hit you on the nose two nights  before. Your attack on her was similar to that on Darren Harwood. You deliberately targeted her neck, stabbing her there, then when she was fatally injured, you stabbed her in the back. She too never had a chance to defend herself.    5.	  For a matter of seconds Darren Harwood must have been down in your room before  he  got  up  and  staggered  out  towards  the  kitchen,  where  he  was  seen  by  Ashley Gadbury, as was Keyleigh Wright pushing past him. During the short time he was on  the  floor  in  your  room,  Charlotte  Piccaver  had  been  stabbed  and  bled  onto  him.  However,  whatever  the  sequence  of  these  attacks,  what  is  clear  is  that,  contrary  to your  story  in  interview  and  in  evidence,  there  was  no  struggle  with  your  victims  in your bedroom, whether on or near the head of the bed or anywhere else in the room. If there had been a struggle on or near the head of the bed, there would have been signs of that struggle, bed clothes disrupted, blood stains on the bed or floor and the orange  juice  carton  overturned,  yet  there  were  no  such  signs  at  all.  Equally  if,  as  you suggested  in  evidence,  you  were  struggling  and  grappling  with  Darren  Harwood  or  Charlotte  Piccaver  whilst  you  had  the  knife,  it  is  inconceivable  that  they  would  not  have  sustained  defensive  injuries  to  their  hands  and  arms  and  yet  they  had  no  such injuries.  Had  there  been  the  life  and  death  struggle  you  described,  you  would  also have sustained far more serious injuries than you did and your blood would have been in the bedroom.     6.	  The  reality  is  that  there  was  no  struggle  and  there  was  no  threat  to  your  life  from either of them or, once she was disarmed, from Keyleigh Wright. The injuries Darren Harwood  and  Charlotte  Piccaver  sustained,  straight  in  and  out  stab  wounds,  are wholly inconsistent with a struggle or with lashing out at your victims in a frenzied loss of control, but are consistent with a deliberate targeted revenge attack, albeit in anger, on two unarmed people. That is what this was.    7.	  The psychological and emotional impact of the murder of these two young people on their  parents  and  their  siblings  has  been  truly  devastating.  I  have  read  the  moving family  impact  statements  of  Charlotte’s  mother,  father  and  sisters  and  of  Darren’s  father.  In a very real sense you have destroyed their lives as well.   8.	  The  mandatory  sentence  for  murder  is  life  imprisonment  and  that  is  the  sentence  of  the  Court  upon  you.  However,  under  Section  269  and  Schedule  21  of  the  Criminal Justice Act 2003 I have to determine the minimum term you should serve before you will be eligible to be considered by the Parole Board for release.   9.	  Clearly  this  case  falls  within  paragraph  5  of  Schedule  21,  since  the  seriousness  of your offending is particularly high and involves the murder of two people, for which the starting point in determining the minimum term is 30 years. I emphasise though that is only the starting point and I have to consider what aggravating and mitigating factors there are in order to determine the appropriate minimum term. Paragraphs 10 and 11 of Schedule 21 set out some of the aggravating and mitigating factors which may be relevant to the offence of murder, but neither list is intended to be exclusive  2 and  what  may  aggravate  or  mitigate  the  offence  will  depend  upon  all  the circumstances of the particular case.   10. None  of  the  statutory  aggravating  factors  set  out  in  Paragraph  10  is  present  in  this case, but the very nature of this savage and targeted attack on two unarmed people is of such seriousness as put this case at or just above the 30 year starting point.    11. So far as the mitigating factors in paragraph 11 are concerned, sub-paragraph (a) does not apply because you clearly intended to kill all your victims, not just to cause them  serious bodily injury. So far as sub-paragraph (b), lack of premeditation, is concerned, on  my  assessment  of  the  evidence,  you  did  not  have  the  knife  at  the  outset  of  the  argument with Keyleigh Wright. It was she who brought it into the bedroom and you then wrested it from her. The fact that you did not take the knife into the room, which means there was no premeditation, is a mitigating factor which justifies bringing the  minimum term down below the 30 year starting point.   12. In my judgment, there is no provocation to be considered under paragraph 11(d). By its verdict the jury rejected your defence of loss of control and, in your own evidence in  cross-examination,  you  accepted  more  than  once  that  you  had  not  lost  your  self-control, saying that, had you done so, you would have followed Keyleigh Wright and Darren Harwood out of the room and would not have called the emergency services.  13. On my assessment of the evidence, paragraph (e): “the fact that the offender acted to any extent in self-defence or in fear of violence” is not a mitigating factor available to you or if it is available, only to a limited extent. I say that because whilst when you wrested  the  knife  away  from  Keyleigh  Wright,  you  may  have  been  acting  in  self-defence or acting in fear of violence from her, there never was any attack on you by Darren Harwood and Charlotte Piccaver except in her case possibly verbal abuse and, once you had the knife, they were all unarmed. In killing them, you did not act in self-defence or in fear of violence but in anger and revenge.   14. Whilst  it  is  true  that  you  were  essentially  of  previous  good  character,  that  can  have little if any impact upon the severity of the sentence in view of the barbaric nature of these  killings.  As  for  the  question  of  remorse,  having  seen  and  heard  you  give evidence,  your  lack  of  respect  for  your  victims  led  me  to  have  some  doubt  whether you  had  any  genuine  remorse  as  opposed  to  feeling  sorry  for  the  situation  in  which you find yourself. Nonetheless, given that immediately after the attack you summoned the emergency services, I accept you had some remorse. However, the gravity of your  offending is so serious that remorse can only play a very limited role in mitigation.  15. I have also borne in mind your age and the fact that the minimum term you will serve will inevitably mean that you will be quite an old man before the Parole Board will consider whether you are eligible for parole. However, in a very real sense, that is an inevitable consequence of the seriousness of your offending.   16. Balancing the savage nature of this killing of two unarmed people with a knife against  the  mitigating  factors  I  have  identified,  in  my  judgment  the  appropriate  minimum term is one of 27 years.  3          17. From  that  will  be  deducted  the  days  you  have  spent  in  custody  in  relation  to  this offence.  What  this  means  is  that  the  minimum  amount  of  time  you  will  spend  in  prison  from  today  before  the  Parole  Board  can  order  early  release  is  27  years  less  those days on remand. If it remains necessary for the protection of the public, you will continue  to  be  detained  after  that  date.  If  the  Parole  Board  does  decide  to  direct release you will remain on licence for the remainder of your life and may be recalled to prison at any time.    18. The statutory surcharge provisions will apply.          4
