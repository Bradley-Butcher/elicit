      R v Tony McLernon    Chelmsford Crown Court    6 March 2013    Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Fulford                                                                                                                                                                                            This incident, brutal and terrible in itself, must be put in its true context, and that is that you have an   undoubted capacity to act violently and dangerously towards others and particularly young women  with whom you have a sexual relationship, whether or not under the influence of alcohol. The   evidence from Kimberly Mitchell and Jessica Matthews, together with the history of your relationship  with the deceased, has vividly demonstrated the troubling way in which you control, dominate,   degrade, bully and finally attack women in these circumstances. I found the evidence called by the    prosecution on this issue compelling, and your behaviour has demonstrated a consistent pattern   over many years, but it is not limited to women as the attack on James Abinger last year vividly    revealed.    As long ago as 2004 you attacked Kimberly Mitchell when you were 15 and 14 respectively. Over the   2 years of your relationship with her you prevented her from seeing her friends and she practically    ceased going to school, you undermined her self‐confidence and self esteem, you assaulted her  violently and you threatened her with knives. The assaults included punching her, stamping or   treading on her head and holding knives against her body in a terrifying way. In 2006 your violence   resulted in a hairline fracture to her jaw and bad bruising to her face. You even hit her inside a police   station, causing her head to bounce off a glass partition. You threatened Jessica Matthews, another  of your girlfriends, with a knife in Oct 2007, when you ordered her to knees and told her that you   would stab her if she moved, having placed the knife, more than once, against her stomach. The   police who arrested you witnessed this incident. You repeatedly punched James Abinger’s head,   whilst holding him down, because he contradicted you. You repeatedly and brutally assaulted Eystna    Blunnie during the course of your relationship and her friends and family frequently saw very bad     bruising to her upper body, of which she was ashamed and tried to hide and about which you  persuaded her lie, particularly by suggesting it was the result of play fighting. It would seem that Dr    Locke and Dr Abou‐El‐Fadl are undoubtedly correct when they describe you as having an emotionally   unstable personality disorder which is characterised, amongst other things, by displays of extreme  anger and rage. However, the medical profession has evaluated you over the years on the basis of   only a partial history, because the doctors have been unaware of the extent of the violence I have  just described and you lied significantly to Dr Abou‐El‐Fadl about the course of your relationship with   Eystna Blunnie, to say nothing of the circumstances of her death. You falsely blamed her for   everything and you failed to reveal the repeated violence you visited on her, together with way you    controlled and bullied her.    You repeatedly indicated that you wanted Eystna Blunnie significantly harmed or killed. In April you   strangled her with such force she thought you were going to kill her and her baby started reacting in   distress. It is likely she only survived because your parents intervened. On 3 May 2012 you sent a text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          R v Tony McLernon    Chelmsford Crown Court    6 March 2013    Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Fulford                                                                                                                                                                                            This incident, brutal and terrible in itself, must be put in its true context, and that is that you have an   undoubted capacity to act violently and dangerously towards others and particularly young women  with whom you have a sexual relationship, whether or not under the influence of alcohol.
