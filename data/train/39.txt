  R -V-  JAMES MCCORMICK   CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT  2 MAY 2013   SENTENCING REMARKS OF HIS HONOUR JUDGE  HONE  QC    This is a most serious case.  You are the driving force and sole director of ATSC Ltd and    you, with a small number of agents employed by you, sold over 7000 ADE devices to the  Iraqi Government and other international agencies for prices varying between $30,000   and a low point of $2,500 per unit.  One composite invoice shows total sales in excess of  $38m to Iraq over nearly three years. You sold in lesser quantities to other countries and in your evidence you acknowledged sales exceeding $50m.  The cost of the ADE devices,    modelled  on  failed  American  manufactured  Golf  Ball  Detectors,  was  below  $50  a  unit.   The device was useless, the profit outrageous and your culpability as a fraudster has to be   placed  in  the  highest  category.    The  principal  aggravating  feature  is  that  although  it      cannot be proved that the use of the device caused a specific death or loss of limb – and I           accept  that  at  Iraqi  checkpoints  other  detection  devices  were  used  –  yet  what  you    perpetrated was a callous confidence trick.  The jury found that you knew the devices did    not  work,  yet  the  soldiers  in  Iraq  and  elsewhere  believed  in  them,  in  part  due  to  your       powers of salesmanship and in part the extravagant and fraudulent claims made in your       promotional material.  After a six week trial, I am wholly satisfied that your fraudulent   conduct in selling so many useless devices for simply enormous profit promoted a false sense of security and in all probability materially contributed to causing death and injury  to innocent individuals.  It is this exceptional feature which distinguishes your case from     the usual case of fraud.  Although I have paid attention to the Sentencing Guideline, your       case  is  far  outside  any  of  parameters  set  out  and  neither  the  starting  points  nor  the     1  sentencing ranges are adequate for your case. Although you have been convicted of three   counts because  you produced three devices,  it  seems to  me  the three  devices  were  very   similar  and  there  was  one  course  of  conduct.  In  terms  of  culpability  and  harm,  I  have       been unable to imagine a more serious case of its kind.  There are five relevant matters.       First, well over 7000 devices were sold in Iraq and elsewhere; second, they were sold and used for a period of nearly three years and indeed in some arenas they remain in use as a     continuing potential danger to life; third, soldiers, police forces, border customs officers,    hotel security staff and many other users trusted their lives to the overpriced devices sold    by you, which were no more than crude plastic components with a disconnected antenna     and  a  capability  of  detecting  explosives  no  better  than  random  chance;  fourth,  your    profits were obscene, funding grand houses, a greedy and extravagant lifestyle and even   a yacht;  fifth, you have neither insight, shame or any sense of remorse.  Even now you   insist  they  work,  in  a  vain  effort  to  minimise  your  culpability.  There  is  no  significant   personal mitigation. You fought the case in the teeth of overwhelming evidence.  In a last desperate gamble, you rolled the dice with the jury and you lost.    As I have said, it is difficult to think of a more serious case.  It is possible that other cases    may  equal  what  you  did  and  some  may  conceivably  involve  more  money,  but  I  am     confident that no other case can be significantly worse in terms of culpability and harm.  In  addition,  a  maximum  sentence  in  your  case  can  be  justified  to  deter  others  from   committing  similar  offences.    The  five  points  I  have  mentioned,  in  particular  your    cavalier disregard of the potentially fatal consequences of your fraudulent activity, have  convinced  me that the  appropriate sentence in  your case  is the rare step of passing the    maximum that section 7 of the Fraud Act 2006 allows.  The sentence of the court is that      you  must  serve  the  maximum  term  of  10  years  imprisonment  on  each  count   You will serve half that term in custody and you will then be released on licence.  If you    commit  any  further  offence  or  breach  the  terms  of  your  licence  you  will  surely  be   returned to custody.  Confiscation proceedings will follow.  That concludes the sentence   concurrently.  in your case. 2
