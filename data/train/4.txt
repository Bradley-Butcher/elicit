  THE HON MR JUSTICE HOLROYDE A PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE NORTHERN CIRCUIT    IN THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT   T1992 0238   THE QUEEN -v- ASIL NADIR SENTENCING REMARKS 23 AUGUST 2012        Asil  Nadir,  you  are  a  man  of  outstanding  business  skills,  and  in  the  1980s  you achieved remarkable success.  In a decade you developed Polly Peck International plc into  a  multi-national  business.    You  no  doubt  brought  employment  and  financial benefit to many persons around the world.  You are entitled to take great pride in that achievement.    The  company’s  success  was  in  many  ways  your  success.    But  the company’s  money  was  not  your  money.    You  knew  that.    You  nonetheless  helped yourself to it.  You committed theft on a grand scale.   You have been convicted of 10 offences of theft.  The first involved the theft by you of £5,150,000 on 14th August 1987 – 25 years ago last week.  The last involved the theft of another £5 million three years later, on 6th August 1990.  In all, during that three-year period, you stole from PPI sums totalling £28.6 million, and US$500,000 with a sterling  equivalent  at  the  time  of  nearly  £300,000.    Without  making  any  detailed analysis of changes in the value of money over the intervening years, it is fair to say that the total sum stolen equates to more than £60 million today.   You committed those thefts by authorising or instructing the transfer of monies out of PPI’s bank accounts in London.  The monies were then moved through various other bank  accounts,  in  particular  a  bank  account  of  a  PPI  subsidiary  company  known  as    the Unipac Jersey account, to end uses which were nothing to do with PPI’s business but were instead for the benefit of you, your family and associates.  The flow charts which  were  provided  to  the  jury  showed  the  complex  routes  which  the  money  took before reaching those end uses.  That complexity was intended by you, and designed, to  obscure  and  conceal  the  reality  of  what  you  were  doing.    The  transactions  were accounted  for  in  the  books  and  records  of  PPI  in  such  a  way  that  it  appeared  that funds  were  legitimately  being  transferred,  for  company  purposes,  to  subsidiary companies  in  northern  Cyprus  and  Turkey.    The  reality  was  that  you  were  stealing from the company.     It is relevant to give some brief examples of the end uses to which the stolen money was  applied.    It  was  used  to  buy  shares  in  PPI,  both  in  your  own  name  and  in  the names of others who were clearly your nominees and controlled by you.   It was used to  acquire  or  fund  various  businesses  and  properties  from  which  you  benefited.    It was used to pay your personal expenditure, including a tax bill of over £1 million.   On one  occasion,  stolen  money  was  even  used  to  make  a  donation  to  charity  in  your name.  The fact that stolen money was used to fund an extravagant lifestyle can often be  a  very  significant  aggravating  feature  in  cases  of  theft.  I  do  not  regard  it  as counting  particularly  heavily  against  you  here,  because  it  seems  to  me  that  you already had an extravagant lifestyle as a result of your success in business.  It follows, however, that you were a wealthy man who stole out of pure greed.  The direct consequence of your crimes was that the company suffered the loss of just under £29 million.  But that was not the only consequence.  In the late summer and autumn  of  1990,  the  bankers  who  had  previously  been  glad  to  lend  money  to  PPI began  to  seek  repayment  of  short-term  loans  as  they  fell  due.    There  was  then  an urgent need for cash to be remitted from the near east subsidiary companies to PPI head  office  in  London  so  that  the  most  pressing  demands  could  be  met  and  the confidence  of  the  lending  banks  restored.    But  nothing  was  remitted.    You  gave  a series  of  assurances  to  your  fellow  directors  and  to  the  banks  as  to  particular  sums being  available  by  particular  dates.    None  of  those  assurances  was  kept.    No  money was  made  available.    After  a  time,  the  banks  –  unsurprisingly  -  would  no  longer accept  your  talk  of  money  arriving  shortly.    One  bank  pressed  particularly  hard  for repayment  of  a  comparatively  small  loan.    You  were  told  of  that  demand  for Page 2 of 9 repayment,  and  promised  in  a  telephone  call  that  you  would  fix  it.    The  evidence makes  me  sure  that  you  fixed  it  by  arranging  for  one  of  your  assistants  to  forge  a letter  which  purported  to  be  confirmation  from  a  bank  that  the  necessary  funds would be remitted.  That was not the only document which was falsified by those who were  assisting  you  in  northern  Cyprus,  and  again  the  evidence  makes  me  sure  that your hand was behind the various forgeries and other false accounting records which were used to conceal the thefts of which you have been convicted.     Your  fellow  directors  decided,  entirely  understandably,  that  there  was  no  realistic option open to them other than to petition for PPI to be placed into administration. In  your  evidence  to  the  jury  you  unjustly  accused  those  directors  of  having  been intimidated by legal advice as to their prospective personal liabilities if PPI continued trading  whilst  insolvent.    You  further  accused  many  others  of  incompetence,  wrong doing and malice.  You blamed everyone but yourself for the collapse of PPI.  I accept that there may well have been many complex factors which collectively brought about that  collapse,  and  I  agree  with  Mr  Hackett  that  it  would  be  wrong  to  say  that  you alone  were  responsible  for  it.    However,  the  evidence  makes  me  sure  that  one substantial cause of the collapse was the failure of the near east subsidiaries to remit any cash when it was so urgently needed.  If all the money was where it should have been, and if there was nothing to hide, then the failure to send any of it from northern Cyprus  to  London  was  inexplicable.  Whatever  concerns  the  directors  of  those subsidiaries may have had as to their future, the evidence makes it entirely clear that they  would  obey  your  direct  instructions.  But  of  course  the  money  which  you  had stolen  was  not  where  it  should  have  been,  and  so  you  did  have  something  to  hide.  The evidence I have heard therefore drives me to the conclusion that you, having on ten  occasions  stolen  PPI’s  money,  were  determined  to  frustrate  any  meaningful investigation of the finances of the near east subsidiaries which would have revealed those  thefts.  I  am  sure  that  for  that  reason  you  were  responsible  for  the  failure  to remit  funds.  You  blame  others  for  the  collapse  of  PPI,  but  the  evidence  makes  me sure that your conduct in committing those ten thefts, and in seeking to cover them up, was at least one of the substantial causes of it.  With that collapse, of course, came financial loss to all who had invested in PPI: not just large institutional investors, but private investors and persons whose pension funds were partly invested in PPI shares.     Page 3 of 9 You  were  arrested  and  charged.  After  lengthy  preparation,  your  trial  was  set  for September 1993.  You did not remain in this country to stand trial.  Instead, in May 1993,  you  fled  to  northern  Cyprus.    No  doubt  you  had  been  under  very  great  stress and pressure in the period before your departure, and I accept that for at least a short time your health suffered as a result; but you had brought the stress of criminal and civil proceedings upon yourself by your thefts from PPI.    Mr Hackett asks me to have regard to what were on any view extraordinary events in the proceedings around that time, which he submits would have shaken the confidence of anyone in your position.  I am not persuaded by that point; but even if I were, it does not begin to explain your then staying in northern Cyprus.  You remained absent from this country for 17 years, and so delayed for nearly two decades the day of reckoning which has finally arrived.     It  is  important  that  I  should  make  clear  to  you  and  to  the  public  the  sentencing principles which I have applied.   First,  the  jury  heard  evidence  about  many  transfers  of  money  which  were  not  the subject of counts in the indictment.  Although that evidence was properly considered by them, the law provides that the court can sentence only for the specific offences of which you have been convicted.  I make it plain that is what I will do.   Next, the approach the court must take in sentencing for crimes committed long ago has been indicated by the Court of Appeal in the recent case of R v H & Others [2012] 1  WLR  1416.    I  must  apply  current  statutory  provisions.    You  therefore  gain  the benefit  of  a  statutory  amendment  which  has  come  into  force  since  you  committed your crimes, the effect of which is that the maximum sentence for any one offence is now 7 years imprisonment even though it was 10 years at the time when the offences were committed.   I must have regard to the purposes of sentencing set out in section 142  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003,  and  by  section  143  of  that  Act  I  must  have regard to the seriousness of the offences, taking into account your culpability and the harm which your offending caused.   Next,  I  must  also  have  regard  to  the  sentencing  guidelines  which  are  now  in  force, notwithstanding  that  they  did  not  exist  when  the  offences  were  committed.    The relevant guideline is that applicable to offences of theft committed in breach of trust.  Page 4 of 9      It indicates a starting point of 3 years’ imprisonment, and a range of 2 to 6 years, for a man  of  previous  good  character  convicted  after  trial  of  a  single  offence  of  theft  of  a sum  of  £125,000  or  more.  You,  of  course,  have  been  convicted  of  ten  offences, involving far larger sums.   In  assessing  the  seriousness  of  your  offences,  I  regard  the  following  as  aggravating features. First,  the  combination  of  your  breach  of  the  trust  reposed  in  you  by  your  fellow directors, and your abuse of your position of authority and control over PPI in general and the near east subsidiaries in particular.  It is true that you were but one director in a board of directors; but the evidence in this trial has shown very clearly that you were a dominant figure, especially so in relation to anything to do with the near east subsidiaries.  You were in a position to use that dominance for good or for ill.  You chose to use it in ways which enabled you to commit theft.  A particular example of that  is  your  determined  retention  of  your  sole  signatory  status  in  respect  of  the Unipac Jersey account, a status which you cynically exploited by using that account to disguise what was really happening to the funds which had left PPI. Secondly, the number of your offences and the extent of the loss which you caused.    Thirdly,  your  persistence  in  stealing  over  a  period  of  time.  In  this  regard,  I  take particular note of the evidence that in October 1989 you were spoken to by one of the company’s  auditors,  who  had  cause  to  question  a  particular  transaction.  You  gave him an untruthful explanation, which concealed what had really happened. Even on that  basis,  he  advised  you  that  what  you  had  done  was  extremely  unwise.  You  were not deterred by that warning.  You went on to commit three further offences. Fourthly, the sophistication of the manner in which the thefts were committed, and your  concealment  of  your  crimes  by  causing  others  to  make  false  entries  in  the company’s  books  and  records.    You  were  assisted  by  a  number  of  persons  in  this country and abroad: each of them was an employee of PPI or of a company which had been set up to manage your personal wealth, and in that way you exploited the fact that you were in effective charge of both companies.   Page 5 of 9       As  to  matters  of  mitigation,  I  take  into  account  the  following  points  which individually and collectively enable me to reduce to some extent the sentences which would otherwise be appropriate. First, your previous good character.  Allied to that, I accept Mr Hackett’s submission that the court can be confident you will not reoffend.   Secondly,  your  central  role  in  the  successful  development  of  PPI  and  the  benefits  it brought to many employees and investors before its collapse. Thirdly,  and  importantly,  your  voluntary  return  to  this  country.    The  jury’s  verdicts establish  that  you  did  not  return  because  you  were  an  innocent  man  who  had  been the  victim  of  injustice.    But  whatever  its  true  motivation  may  have  been,  that voluntary return enabled the trial to proceed.   Fourthly,  the  fact  that  having  returned  the  conditions  of  your  bail  required  you  to observe  a  nightly  curfew  which  continued  for  nearly  two  years.    Although  not qualifying  by  statute  for  a  specific  reduction  in  your  sentence,  I  accept  that  it constituted a significant restraint upon your liberty which I should take into account.  I similarly take into account the short periods which you spent in police custody.   Fifthly,  your  current  state  of  health.    I  have  at  an  earlier  stage  of  these  proceedings received medical evidence, in particular the reports of two consultant cardiologists.   I am aware that you underwent a medical procedure in 2005, and that your condition requires  medication  and  regular  monitoring.   It  appears  however  that  your cardiovascular condition is stable under this medication, and has not worsened since 2005.    You  must  understand  that  in  the  ordinary  way,  the  ill  health  of  a  person sentenced  to  imprisonment  is  a  matter  for  the  prison  authorities,  not  a  reason  to reduce what would otherwise be the appropriate sentence. As Mr Hackett realistically accepts, the evidence I have heard as to your state of health does not indicate that it is so  poor  as  to  render  imprisonment  unusually  difficult  or  onerous  in  your  case.  I nonetheless  think  it  appropriate  to  take  your  poor  health  into  account  when considering your voluntary return to this country: it provided another reason why you Page 6 of 9 might  have  chosen  to  remain  in  the  near  east,  and  it  is  to  your  credit  that  you nonetheless returned.   In  a  similar  way,  I  take  into  account  your  age  as  another  factor  relevant  to  your voluntary return.  You were aged 69 at that time, which was another reason why you might have chosen to remain in northern Cyprus.  On that ground alone, your age is a factor which counts to some extent in your favour.  I make it plain however that in my judgment  your  age  does  not  assist  you  in  any  other  way,  for  the  simple  reason  that you chose to flee the jurisdiction and remain absent from this country for 17 years.  If you had stood trial in 1993, as you should have done, you would have been 52 years old.   I have considered but rejected other possible mitigating features. You are not assisted by the fact that you yourself lost a lot of money when PPI’s share price collapsed: that was another self-inflicted wound. Finally I should mention that there is here no mitigation in the nature of remorse for your past offending. You were entitled to have your trial, and you were entitled before that trial to make the several applications you did seeking on legal grounds to prevent the trial ever going ahead. The fact that you exercised those rights does not make your crimes  more  serious  than  they  already  are,  and  does  not  in  any  way  increase  the sentences  which  would  otherwise  be  appropriate.  But  it  does  mean  that  I  have  had the opportunity to observe you not only throughout the months which this trial has occupied  but  also  at  the  many  pre-trial  hearings  which  I  have  conducted  since  late 2010.  You are a man of considerable charm and unfailing courtesy, and it is sad to see the waste of your undoubted talents.  But I have no hesitation in concluding that you  have  shown  not  the  slightest  remorse  for  your  crime.  Your  sole  concern throughout has been to avoid any acceptance of your own responsibility.      Balancing  those  various  factors,  it  is  in  my  judgment  clear  that  the  aggravating features  substantially  outweigh  the  mitigating  features.    I  am  nonetheless  able  to reflect  such  mitigation  as  there  is  by  reducing  the  total  sentence  which  I  would otherwise  have  passed.    That  total  is  reduced  by  2  years  to  reflect  the  mitigating features which I have identified. Page 7 of 9     I take into account the submissions ably made on your behalf by Mr Hackett.  I take into account also the recent cases which counsel have put before me as indications of the  appropriate  level  of  sentence.    I  agree  with  Mr  Hackett  that  none  of  them  is closely analogous to your case.   I have no doubt that each of your ten offences is so very serious that only a sentence of  imprisonment  is  appropriate,  and  that  the  starting  point  for  each  individual offence  should  be  a  sentence  at  or  near  the  top  of  the  range  indicated  by  the sentencing guidelines.  But of course you are not to be sentenced for only one offence.  Where  offences  are  committed  over  a  significant  period  of  time,  the  court  has  to consider whether concurrent sentences would properly reflect the overall criminality.  In  your  case,  they  would  not.    There  must  be  some  consecutive  sentencing  to  mark your persistence in offending repeatedly over a lengthy period.  In particular, it would in my judgment be wholly wrong not to mark by way of consecutive sentencing your continuing  to  offend  after  the  warning  given  to  you  in  October  1989.    The  fact  that consecutive  sentences  produce  a  total  which  exceeds  the  statutory  maximum  for  a single offence is no bar.  Indeed, there is no bar in principle to the court imposing the maximum  sentence  on  each  of  two  or  more  offences  and  ordering  them  to  run consecutively.   That brings me to the final consideration which the court must have in mind, namely the principle of totality.  If I simply passed the appropriate prison sentence on each count,  and  made  each  of  them  consecutive  to  all  others,  the  total  would  be  far  too high.  I must therefore step back and limit the aggregate sentencing to a total which is proportionate to the overall criminality.  I make it clear that in doing so my primary consideration is the totality of my sentencing, not the precise structure by which that totality is achieved.   My  duty  is  to  determine  the  appropriate  sentence,  not  to  direct  when  you  will  be released.  I must however explain to you the practical effect of my sentence.  Counsel have researched the relevant statutory provisions, and I accept that the effect of them is as follows.  You will serve half of the total sentence which I am about to pronounce.  You  will  then  be  released  on  licence  for  the  remainder  of  the  total  term.  When  so Page 8 of 9 released,  you  will  be  subject  to  the  conditions  of  your  licence,  and  the  Secretary  of State will have the power to withdraw your licence and order your return to prison. On  counts  1,  2,  3,  5,  6,  7  and  8  there  will  be  concurrent  sentences  of  5  years’ imprisonment.    On  counts  10,  12  and  13  there  will  be  sentences  of  5  years’ imprisonment:  those  three  sentences  will  be  concurrent  with  each  other  but consecutive to the other seven sentences.  Your total sentence, accordingly, is one of  10 years’ imprisonment.                            Page 9 of 9
