  R v. Anthony MANN  SENTENCING REMARKS  by The Hon.  Mr Justice Haddon-Cave Crown Court at Warwickshire Justice Centre – 13th April 2015     Introduction 1.  This is an exceptionally sad and tragic case.    2.  On  20th  June  2014,  the  Defendant,  Mr  Anthony  Mann  (aged  78)  stabbed  his  wife, Janet  Mann  (also  aged  78),  in  the  heart  and  killed  her.  They  had  been  happily married  57  years  and  were  a  devoted  and  loving  couple.  Mrs  Mann,  had  been suffering  for  several  years  with  complex  medical  problems  and  increasing  dementia. Mr Mann had been her constant and devoted carer. Her condition had considerably worsened in the previous days and weeks.  She did not want to return to hospital or to  suffer  any  more.    He  was  under  intolerable  strain  at  the  time  and  acted  under impulse. He called the emergency services and admitted what he had done.  3.  As Counsel for the Prosecution, Mr Grieves-Smith, said in his characteristically fair and balanced opening, context is everything.  Mr Mann, I will turn shortly to outline the context in which you committed this act.  Please remain seated for the moment.   Procedural history  4.  When the case was first listed before the Crown Court a guilty plea to murder was indicated  under  the  Early  Guilty  Plea  scheme.    However,  following  a  conference with  his  client,  Mr  Mann, and the family on 26th September 2014, leading counsel Mr Jonas Hankin QC, sensibly advised that a psychiatric opinion should be obtained as  to  the  potential  question  of  diminished  responsibility.    Mr  Hankin  QC  was  no doubt mindful of R v. Inglis [2011] 1 WLR 1110 (paragraphs [41]-[42]).  5.  The  matter  came  before  me  on  10th  October  2014  and,  after  hearing  helpful submissions from Mr Hankin QC and Mr Grieves-Smith, I granted time for both the Defence  and  Prosecution  to  instruct  suitable  consultant  forensic  psychiatrists  to examine the effects upon Mr Mann’s mental health of his wife’s physical and mental deterioration during the period preceding her death.   6.  I  have  had  the  benefit  of  reading  and  studying  the  reports  of  two  eminent  and experienced  Consultant  Forensic  Psychiatrists:  Dr  Dinesh  Maganty  MBBS FRCPsych  (instructed  by  the  Defence),  and  Dr  J.P.  Kenney-Herbert  MBBS FRANZCP  MRCPsych  (instructed  by  the  Prosecution).  Dr  Maganty  and  Dr  Psychiatric reports   1Kenney-Herbert are ad idem:  at the time, Mr Mann, you killed his wife, you were suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning brought about by a combination of  a  moderate  depressive  episode  (or  adjustment  disorder)  combined  with  enforced insomnia,  due  to  your  round-the-clock  caring  responsibilities  for  your  wife,  which substantially impaired your ability to make rational judgments.  I am grateful to both doctors for their lucid and powerful reports.    7.  Dr Maganty referred, insightfully, to the “perfect storm of events” which led tragically to you doing what you did that night.  8.  First and foremost was the deteriorating physical and mental health of your dear wife, Janet. She had suffered medical problems for a long time. In 2008, she was admitted to hospital to remove some piles but due to a urinary infection had to be fitted with a catheter. She found this traumatic and difficult to endure. She complained of pains all down her legs and not being able to sit down and of her skin being ‘on fire’ and not wanting to wear any clothes as a result. Attempts were made to pinpoint the problem and ameliorate the symptoms but without much success, although by 2012 the pain had stabilised somewhat. However, by this time Janet began to suffer from memory loss and the onset of dementia, which included her being unable to recall how to use light switches or to wash.   9.  Second,  was  the  death  of  your  brother  (and  her  brother-in-law),  Roger,  which caused her physical and mental health to deteriorate significantly. She was admitted to hospital on 7th May 2014 in a considerable state of distress rocking back and forth, crying and wailing.  She remained in hospital until 20th May 2014 and whilst there she  said  word  to  the  effect  of  “I  don’t  want  to  live  like  this”  or  “I  don’t  want  to  live anymore”.  She was re-admitted to hospitable on 1st June until 11th June 2014.  Due to  problems  with  her  catheter  which  caused  her  great  pain  and  distress,  Janet  was then  returned  to  hospital  on  12th  to  13th  June  and  again  on  14th  June  2014.    She pulled out several catheters.  10. Third, from the very beginning of these medical problems in 2008, you had been a most  devoted  and  assiduous  carer  for  your  wife,  Janet.  From  2012,  this  effectively became  a  full  time  job:  washing  her,  preparing  special  purée  foods  for  her, accompanying  her  to  the  toilet  (at  least  ‘twenty  times’  a  day),  and  making  sure  she was comfortable at night. You slept on a sofa for six years because your movements on  the  bed  made  her  pain  worse.    You  rarely  had  more  than  3  hours  sleep  at  a stretch.  You wanted to remain close at hand.  11. Fourth, you were described as very “stoical” and “a proud man” who felt that it was your  duty  to  care  for  your  wife  Janet  yourself.  You  were  never  head  to  complain, however difficult it was. Your daughters, Michelle Holmes and Elaine Hassall, visited regularly.  You  are  blessed  with  a  close  and  loving  family.  There  was  community nursing support. But you effectively became homebound to look after your wife as her main carer. And it is clear that you tried your best to cope on a daily basis in very difficult  circumstances,  including  her  regular  manifestations  of  pain  and  distress  and her  confusions.    You  almost  certainly  did  not  appreciate  the  physical  and  mental strain and toll that all this was having on you. It was only latterly, on 18th and 19th June, when things began to deteriorate very seriously, did you begin to ask for extra help  from  social  services.  It  is  significant,  as  Dr  Maganty  has  pointed  out,  that  you had not slept for 24 hours before the night in question.    2  Events of 20th June 2014  12. You called 999 at 02.20 hours on 20th June 2014 and told the call handler “I  have just killed my wife”. You said “she’s in dementia; she’s not slept for two days and she’s very very  distressed  telling  me  to  help  her  to  go”.  The  police  arrived  at  your  house  in Nuneaton in 4 minutes and you showed them to the downstairs bedroom and said “I hope she’s gone.”  The police found your wife lying on her back in bed with an 11 cm kitchen knife sticking out of her upper abdomen, just below the rib cage. You said “I gave her her medication tonight, she has been struggling to go to the toilet, she was asking me to help her and said that I had promised.”  You explained what you had done and told the officer ”I was in the Army.  I was taught to do it properly”.    13. The  post  mortem  evidence  suggested  that  she  would  have  died  quickly.  You  were arrested and taken to the police station. You explained in interview how your wife’s condition  and  ability  to  cope  with  her  catheter  had  been  rapidly  deteriorating  and that the previous two days had been particularly bad. You explained “she’s never been as bad as this; she’s never never screamed, it was like a howl”.  She said did not want to go on or go to hospital and had spat out the sleeping pills you gave her and was trying to pull out the catheter again. You explained how at this point “I went into the kitchen and she was screaming, howling. I thought God Janet and that’s when I did it.” You said “I walked  straight  in  and  stabbed  her  and  that’s  it  finished.    I  put  some  new  underwear  on [her]… and kissed her and said I love you.”  14. Mrs Mann’s death was caused by a single directed thrust into heart. There were no defensive injuries or injuries to indicate forceful restraint or resistance. Death would have occurred rapidly.  Psychiatric reports conclusions – diminished responsibility  15. Dr Maganty stated in the conclusion to his report:  “3.  Mr  Mann,  at  the  material  time  of  the  index  offence,  was  suffering  with  a  moderate depressive  episode,  which  is  a  mental  disorder  within  the  meaning  of  the  Mental  Health  Act 1983  (amended  2007).  This  combined  with  enforced  insomnia  due  to  his  round  the  clock caring responsibility would individually and in combination constitute an abnormality of mental functioning.  A  moderate  depressive  disorder  is  a  recognised  medical  condition.  Mr  Mann’s moderate depressive episode together with the concurrent insomnia affected his rational judgment at the material time and his ability to exercise self-control. Mr Mann was a devoted husband and cared and supported his wife, Janet Mann, on a round the clock basis for years. His love and  care  for  her  has  not  been  questioned  by  the  numerous  individuals  that  have  provided witness statements and also have come into contact with the couple. Unfortunately this led to underestimation of her care needs and his ability to provide the care due to his unquestioning devotion to her. His psychological makeup, which led him to take a position that he did not want  to  “put  on  to  others”  what  he  saw  as  his  duty  to  care  for  his  wife,  led  to  reduced professional  care  for  his  wife  and  him.  In  my  opinion,  I  could  no  identify  any  other  more probable  explanation  for  the  killing  other  than  his  moderate  depressive  episode  affection  his rational judgment and his exercise of self-control leading the index offence. In my opinion, his moderate depressive episode in the circumstances outlined above would provide an explanation for the killing. In my opinion his moderate depressive was a significant contributing factor to the killing.”   3   16. Dr Kenney-Herbert stated in the conclusion to his report:  “87. Mr Mann in many ways underplays the burden of looking after his wife and the effects upon  on  physically  and  psychologically.  To  this  end  it  is  difficult  to  gain  a  clear  history  in details from him regarding his psychological and mental health leading up to the alleged index offence.  However,  based  on  all  the  available  information,  I  think  it  is  highly  likely  he  was suffering from an abnormal mental state at the time of the alleged index offence. He had not slept  for  days  and  this  was  with  a  background  of  chronic  poor  sleep.  He  had  lost  weight  and described  to  Dr  Maganty  feeling  low  in  mood.  He  is  unable  to  grasp  the  complexities  of  his wife’s  situation  and  does  in  particular  focus  that  all  the  problems  were  somehow  related  to  a fractured coccyx from many years ago. It is clear from the information I have seen no-one told him that this was the cause of all her problems. It would appear at the time of the alleged index offence he saw no way forward other than to do what Janet Mann from his perspective wanted him  to  do  and  that  was  to  end  her  suffering  and  to  honour  their  agreement  to  do  so  in  such circumstances. This may present a moderate depressive episode; it could also be described as an adjustment disorder.”  17. I accept both their reports and conclusions. I am also satisfied that, not only did you love  your  wife  very  much,  but  you  were  at  the  time  under  the  most  unbearable strain and suffering from the abnormality of mind described by Dr Maganty and Dr Kenney-Herbert  in  their  reports.  The  use  of  a  knife  to  kill  your  wife  in  this  way exceptional,  but  perhaps  symptomatic  of  your  desperation  in  the  heat  of  the moment. You had not forgotten your training in the Army and knew how to use a knife. As I have said, I am satisfied that you acted on impulse.  18. Mr Grieves-Smith had indicated that, in view of the context and the evidence in this case, the Prosecution will accept a plea to manslaughter in this case on the grounds of diminished  responsibility.    In  my  judgment,  in  the  light  of  the  facts  and  evidence which I have outlined, it is entirely right and appropriate that the Prosecution should do so and I sentence on that basis.  Principles   19. I  have  considered  the  authorities  including,  in  particular,  R  v.  Leslie  Susan  Higgins [1996]  1  Cr  App  R  (S)  271,  R  v  Chambers  5  Cr.  App.  R.  (S)  190),  Attorney General’s  Reference  No.83  of  2009  (Patrick  John  Andrew  Moore)  [2010]  2 Cr.App.R.(S.) 26 at 161, R v Webb  [2011] 2 Cr. App. R. (S) 61, R. v Beaver (Peter Richard) [CACD 24 March 2015, unreported]).  In the light of the authorities, it seems to me that the principles to be applied when sentencing in cases of manslaughter by diminished responsibility such as the present are as follows: (1)  The  fundamental  principle  of  the  sanctity  of  human  life  is  always  to  be respected and reflected in the sentence passed.  (2)  The  culpability  of  the  defendant  in  diminished  responsibility  manslaughter cases may sometimes be reduced almost to extinction, whilst in others it may remain very high.  Each case will depend on its own particular facts. (3) Subject  to  the  specific  element  of  reduced  culpability  inherent  in  the defence, the assessment of the seriousness of the instant offence of diminished    4responsibility  manslaughter  should  have  regard  to  the  guidance  in  Schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003. In  assessing  the  seriousness  of  a  killing  consequent  on  manslaughter  rather than  murder,  regard  should  be  had  to  the  criteria  for  determining  the minimum term to be served in murder cases and then to reduce the sentence to allow for the extent to which the culpability of the offender was reduced by his or her mental condition. In diminished responsibility cases, there are various courses open to a judge. In  cases  where  the  evidence  indicates  that  the  responsibility  of  the  accused for his acts was so grossly impaired that his degree of responsibility for them was minimal, a lenient course will be open to the judge. Provided that there is no danger of repetition of violence, it will usually be possible to make such an  order  as  will  give  the  accused  his  freedom,  possibly  with  some supervision. It is of central importance that a court must not overlook the feelings of the family  of  the  deceased.  It  is  of  the  greatest  importance  that  those  feelings should be respected. (4)  (5) (6) (7) In an appropriate case, the principle of the sanctity of human life would not be undermined if an immediate custodial sentence was not imposed.   Analysis  20. As I said at the beginning, this is an exceptionally sad and tragic case. I am satisfied that the night you killed your wife and were under the most extreme pressure and suffering from an abnormality of mind as described.    21. This  case  has  some  features  in  common  with  R  v.  Webb  (supra)  and  the  following observations of Lord Judge LCJ are pertinent: “24.  On any view this was an exceptionally difficult sentencing exercise. The killing of Mrs Webb was, and will always be, the  result of an unlawful act. On the basis of diminished  responsibility  it  was  not  murder,  but  manslaughter  committed  as  a  mercy killing intended by the appellant to help his wife achieve her settled intention to end her own life, notwithstanding his pleas to her that she should not do so. In our judgment his actions in this case came very close to the offence of assisting in his wife's intended suicide, acting as he did to fulfil her clear, unequivocal wishes to end her life, so that when she failed to achieve what she wanted, he took over from her. 25.  All  this  must  be  set  in  the  context  of  a  man  whose  responsibility,  if  not altogether extinguished, was substantially reduced. We accept the submission that if he had  not  been  in  the  situation  in  which  he  was  and  suffering  from  the  condition  from which he did suffer, it is most unlikely that this killing would have occurred. We remind ourselves of the turmoil which he must have suffered as he committed the last fatal act. 26.  The  appellant  has  now  served  the  equivalent  of  a  sentence  of  six  months' imprisonment. In the unusual and particular circumstances of this case we do not believe that  the  principle  of  the  sanctity  of  human  life  would  be  undermined  if  the  sentence imposed  on  the  appellant  were  now  reduced  to  one  of  twelve  months'  imprisonment, suspended, so that this lonely old man may receive the help that he will need to come to terms with the disaster that has overtaken him.” 5      22. In  R  v.  Webb  (supra),  the  Court  of  Appeal  quashed  the  order  of  immediate imprisonment  and  substituted  an  order  of  twelve  months'  imprisonment  suspended for twelve months and attached a supervision order.  23. R v. Webb was recently considered and applied in R. v Beaver (Peter Richard) (CACD 24  March  2015,  unreported),  on  facts  striking  similar  to  the  present  (although  Beaver could not be described as a case of mercy killing).  The Court of Appeal in that case quashed a sentence of imprisonment of three years and substituted a sentence of two years suspended for two years, with conditions.  Defence submissions  24. I am grateful to Mr Hankin QC for his measured and helpful submissions.  I accept his  central  submission  that  your  responsibility,  Mr  Mann,  for  killing  hour  wife  is substantially  reduced,  if  not  altogether  extinguished,    by  virtue  of  the  depressive episode and adjustment disorder from which you was suffering at the material time. If you had not been in the situation in which you were was and suffering from the condition from which he did suffer, it is most unlikely that this killing would have occurred.   25. I  also  accept,  in  the  light  of  all  the  evidence,  that  your  residual  culpability  was minimal. You are selfless and decent man and devoted to your wife and were, to a large  extent  motivated,  by  a  desire  to  alleviate  your  wife’s  suffering  and  to  honour what  you  saw  as  your  commitment  that  you  should  do  so.  You  were  appalled  by what, cruelly, she was having to endure. You felt were driven to act as he did.   I repeat  that  the  act  of  killing  was  an  impulsive  one,  committed  under  extraordinary stress.   26. Mr Hankin QC rightly acknowledges this was not a case of assisted suicide. It was, rather, a case of ‘mercy killing’ by manslaughter. It is right to acknowledge, however, that this is compelling evidence that Mrs Mann had wanted her suffering to end: (1)  Mrs Mann repeatedly told you that she didn’t want “to go on”. As presaged above,  when  asked  during  the  999  call  why  he  had  killed  his  wife  the defendant said “she’s very, very distressed, telling me to help her go…she asked me for days”. In interview, when explaining why you waited some time before calling the police (to ensure your could not be revived) you said  “she didn’t want  to  come  back,  I  knew  that,  she  didn’t  want  to  come  back…when  we  were younger we always said we’d look after each other…she said ‘I don’t want to live like this’…you’ll help me’”. (2)  During  Mrs  Mann  time  in  hospital  in  May  2014,  she  was  heard  by  her daughter,  Michelle  Holmes,  to  say  “I  don’t  want  to  live  like  this  anymore”. Michelle Holmes also reports that on the 17th June Mrs Mann, when she was crying in agony, said to her “I don’t want to live like this…I don’t want to live anymore”.  (3)  Mrs Mann’s other daughter Elaine Hassall says that she told her “I can’t live like this” and “I don’t want to live like this” many times in May and June.        6(4)  Your  sister  Maxine  Jardine  also  reports  that  during  the  same  period  Mrs. Mann  said  to  her  “I  don’t  want  to  live  like  this,  this  isn’t  living”  and  on  one occasion while in hospital said “I want to die”.  27. As  Mr  Hankin  QC  has  rightly  emphasised,  an  indication  of  how  great  was  the burden was on you that neither daughter, Michelle Holmes or Elaine Hassall, bears any  resentment  towards  him;  indeed  each  expresses  their  relief  that  their  mother’s suffering has ended. As Mr Grieves-Smith has highlighted, both have spoken of you, their father, in the most glowing terms and spoken movingly of the privations your wife suffered and your devoted care for her.   28. Michelle Holmes said in her statement to the Court:   “I  was  devastated  by  the  news  but  in  some  ways  felt  great  relief.  Mum  was  no  longer suffering or in pain and it felt like at last she was at peace as she had been suffering for so long. Immediately I had no hard feelings to my dad. I only felt love, support and gratitude to him…Dad provided mum with amazing care and utter devotion and we are glad of how he cared for her. All our family support him and want him home, none of us feels any ill will towards him.”   29. Elaine Hassall said in her statement to the Court:  “I hold no ill feelings towards dad and fully support him. I understand that he loved her and  did  it  for  her…I  love  my  dad,  I  support  my  dad,  I  support  what  he  has  done.  He adored mum and only did what he did out of love. We do not want him to be in prison, we want him home with us”.  Mitigation  30. You are now 78 years old. You were born in Nuneaton and have lived there all your life.  You  met  your  wife  at  a  dance  when  you  were  seventeen  and  since  then  have never spent much time apart, save for you stint on National Service. You have led an exemplary  life.    After  National  Service  you  worked  as  a  mechanic  in  the  motor industry before joining the Coal Board. You and your late wife were very much part of the local community and had a strong network of friends. You and Janet enjoyed many  activities  together  including  ballroom  dancing,  gardening  and  cycling.    You and  your  wife  did  voluntary  work  for  a  number  of  years  at  the  George  Elliot Hospital  and  for  a  local  cancer  charity.  Your  have  been  described  you  as  a  “very devoted father and husband” and as a very generous person who would “do anything for anyone”.  You have a close and loving family who do not blame you for what you have done.    31. You  are  a  man  in  your  late  seventies.  You  are  someone  of  positive  good  character with an impeccable employment record and a long history of voluntary work.  You have  led  an  industrious,  hardworking  and  decent  life.  You  have  been  devoted  to your wife and family.   32. I  have  been  provided  with  a  file  overflowing  with  testimonials  from  friends, neighbours, acquaintances from all walks of life, many of whom have know you and your wife, Janet, for 30 years or more, who speak eloquently about the strength of your marriage and what a kind, caring couple you were. They speak poignantly and movingly  about  the  years  of  devoted  care  you  gave  to  your  wife.    They  speak  of  7your  kindness  and  generosity  to  everyone  you  met.  I  quote  from  one  letter,    in particular, by way of example: “The best way of describing Tony would be say that he is a prime example of a PERFECT ENGLISH GENTLEMAN. Over the years, he and his wife were inseparable.  He adored her.”    33. In  my  judgment,  in  the  exceptional  circumstances  of  this  case,  an  immediate custodial sentence for manslaughter is not required. This case is at the lowest end of culpability. Your daughters and other family members have clear and unequivocally expressed  the  wish  that  you  (and  they)  do  not  suffer  further  by  you  being  sent  to prison.  This  seems  to  me  to  be  a  paradigm  case  for  leniency  and  mercy.  The principle  of  the  sanctity  of  human  life  would  not  be  undermined  if  the  sentence imposed on you were to be suspended.     34. There is no public interest or need to send you to prison.  I am satisfied that, given the exceptional circumstances of this case, and whilst mindful of the need to reflect the sanctity of human life, this case can nevertheless properly be dealt with by way of a Suspended Sentence Order.  35. You reported what you had done and fully assisted the police in their enquiries into the  circumstances  of  his  wife’s  death.  You  pleaded  guilty  at  the  first  opportunity. You do not pose a danger to the public in any way. I am satisfied that is not a case where  any  form  of  supervision  is  necessary.  The  recent  amendments  to  the suspended  sentence  provisions  by  LASPOA  2012  now  allow  for  a  suspended sentence for up to two year’s duration and for a sentence to be suspended without any community requirements being attached to that sentence (c.f. Archbold 5-538).  Sentence  36. Mr Mann, please stand up. You have pleaded not guilty today to murder but guilty to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. That is a plea with the Court accepts. For this offence, for the reasons I have given, the sentence which I impose is a  sentence  of  two  years  imprisonment,  suspended  for  two  years.  The  usual  victim surcharge order applies.  37. I  am  grateful  to  Mr  Grieves-Smith  and  Mr  Hankin  QC  for  their  able  assistance today.  8
