     R ‐V‐ NATHAN PICK  NOTTINGHAM CROWN COURT   10 MAY 2013     SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE FLAUX                                                1.	  Nathan Pick on 8 May 2013 you pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of your 7  month old son James Pick who died a year ago on 9 May 2012. At the time    you  lived  with  the  baby’s  mother,  your  then  partner  Hannah  Goldby  in   Chaddesden, Derby.  The background to this tragic death is as follows. James   was born on 5 October 2011 with  a number of medical problems requiring  surgical  treatment,  including  corrective  heart  surgery.  A  little  over  three  months  of  his  early  life  were  spent  in  hospital.  These  medical  difficulties   meant he had to be fed through a naso‐gastric tube. I accept that you helped  with this task. Despite these problems once settled at home he was reported   as growing well and developing normally.                                                                                                  2.	  Up  until  about  March  last  year  your  relationship  with  your  son  appeared   normal, but around that time it changed for the worse. Whenever you went  near  James he  would  become  distressed and  scream  or  cry. As soon  as his  mother  took  him  he  would  settle  down.  You  clearly  found  this  reaction  of  your son frustrating and upsetting and described it to a cousin of Hannah’s in   April  2012  as  breaking  your  heart.  The  problems  you  had  of  bonding  with  James and  the  demands of  caring  for  him  put a  strain  on your  relationship   with Hannah. You told her you could not cope with the crying and wanted to   give up.                                                                                           3.	  On  Sunday  6  May  2012  Hannah  left  you  alone  for  the  day  with  James  and   went to her mother’s. You rang up clearly stressed saying James would not   stop screaming and could Hannah come home. She said she would return in  an hour but you asked her to come straight away such was the stress. When  she  walked  into  the  house  he  stopped  crying  and  you  said  “thank  fuck  for    that”.                                                         4.	  On Tuesday 8 May 2012 in the afternoon the three of you went into Derby  city  centre.  On  arrival  you  went  off  on  your  own  to  chill  out  with  friends   whilst Hannah and James went shopping then went home where she fed him.                                       1                                                                        You  got  home  about  5.30.  Hannah’s  mother  came  round  with  some  medication for the baby shortly before 6.15. You and Hannah decided to have   fish and chips and her mother drove her to the local fish bar to buy the food.  At  the  time  she  left  James  was  asleep  in  his  swing  chair.  Almost  on  arrival   inside the shop at about 6.26 so only some ten minutes after she had left you  alone with the baby, she had a telephone call from you asking her to come  back quickly, saying he’s fitting and I think he’s dead. She came back having     told  you  to  dial  999  which  you  did.  The  ambulance  came  and  James  was   taken initially to Royal Derby Hospital then to the QMC here in Nottingham. A   CT  scan  and  subsequent  MRI  scan  revealed  extensive  brain  injury  with   haemorrhaging,  brain  swelling  and  bleeding  into  the  spinal  cord  and   examination by an eye specialist revealed extensive injuries to the backs of  the eyes including haemorrhages and retinal detachment. It became clear to   all the treating doctors that further intensive care was futile and James was   taken off life support and died at 10.26pm on 9 May 2012.                                                                                                                         5.	  The  post  mortem  examinations  by  Dr  Stuart  Hamilton  and  other  specialist    pathologists  found  numerous  head  injuries  and  extensive  brain  injury  and   catastrophic  bleeding  to  the  eyes  and  retina  all  indicative  of  severe  blunt   trauma and inconsistent with an accident or with accidental impact with the  baby’s swing chair which is what you were suggesting had happened. Despite  the weight of that medical evidence pointing to deliberate infliction of these  injuries  upon  the  baby,  until  your  plea  of  guilty  two  days  ago  you  were    maintaining  you  were  not  responsible,  that  the injuries  had  arisen   accidentally or that James’ mother was in some way to blame.                                                                                                                 6.	  As you now accept by your plea of guilty to manslaughter, you had caused   those injuries which led to James’ death. When Hannah went out to fetch fish  and  chips,  as  always  happened  when  the  baby  was  left  alone  with  you,  he   started  screaming.  The  stress  and  frustration  that  generated  in  you  caused  you  to  snap  and  in  momentary  anger  you  hit  James  with  the  back  of  your   hand so that he hit his head on the chair. You did not intend to kill him or  cause him serious physical injury, but again, as your guilty plea demonstrates,  you  now  accept  that  this  blow  was  an  unlawful  act  which  any  reasonable  person  would  have  realised  would  cause  James  some  physical  harm.  How  could it be otherwise with a small vulnerable baby?                                                                                                                         7.	  This is a tragic case in which a moment of anger and frustration caused the  death of your baby son, a senseless act of violence with the consequences of    which you will have to live for the rest of your life. It has ruined the life of    your ex‐partner Hannah who had already previously lost another baby Zoe in  a cot death and it has devastated her family. I have considered the moving    impact statement from Hannah. Inevitably as people do in such situations she  asks herself over and over what she could have done to stop you and blames  herself, when the stark reality is that only you are to blame for the death of  your son. I have also borne in mind in sentencing you the effect on your other   child, your 12 year old son.                                                                                             2                 8.	  Manslaughter  is  a  serious  offence  for  the  purposes  of  the  dangerousness   provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 but I am satisfied that you are not   dangerous within the meaning of those provisions. Nonetheless the case is of   such  seriousness  that  it  passes  the  custody  threshold  and  clearly  only  a  substantial custodial sentence would be appropriate to meet the seriousness  of the offence you have admitted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                9.	  The authorities on sentencing for manslaughter since the enactment of the  Criminal Justice Act 2003 have emphasised that whilst there is no express link  between the guidance in Schedule 21 to that Act as it applies to murder and   sentencing for manslaughter, the Act has increased the punitive element in   the sentence for murder and the intention of Parliament is clear that other  crimes which result in death such as manslaughter should be treated more   seriously  and  dealt  with  more  severely  than  before.  That  point  was  made  expressly  in  the  context  of  diminished  responsibility  manslaughter  by  Lord   Judge CJ in R v Wood [2010] 1 Cr App R(S) 2 at [23]. Precisely the same point   was  made  by  the  Lord  Chief  Justice  in  the  context  of  unlawful  act  manslaughter arising out of street disorder in  Appleby [2010] 2 Cr App R(S)  46 at [22].      10. In	  R  v  Burridge  [2010]  EWCA  Crim  2847  at  [137]  to  [139]  Leveson  LJ   considered  those  authorities  and  concluded  the  principles  set  out  in  those  authorities  applied  equally  to  unlawful  act  manslaughter  of  babies  and  children.  In that case the defendant was convicted of the murder of his baby  son, but on appeal the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on the grounds of   fresh  evidence  and  substituted  a  verdict  of  manslaughter.  In  those   circumstances the defendant fell to be sentenced by the Court of Appeal for    manslaughter.  The  Court  of  Appeal  substituted  a  sentence  of  10  years    imprisonment for the original sentence for murder of life imprisonment with    a minimum term of 13 years.     11. Your counsel Mr Smith QC relies upon the subsequent decision of the Court   of  Appeal  in  Draper  [2011]  EWCA  Crim  640  as  setting  Burridge  in  context.  That was an Attorney General’s Reference in respect of a sentence of three  and  a  half  years  imprisonment  in  fact  by  the  same  trial  judge  as  Burridge   where, as in this case, the defendant had killed his baby son and had been   originally  charged  with  murder  but  a  plea  of  manslaughter  was  eventually   accepted  by  the  prosecution.  The  Court  of  Appeal  found  the  sentence  was  too  lenient  and  substituted  one  of  5  years  imprisonment.  It  is  to  be  noted   that  in  his  judgment  the  Lord  Chief  Justice  endorsed  the  conclusion  by  the   Court in Burridge that the principles in Wood and Appleby applied equally to    cases of unlawful act manslaughter of babies and children.     12. In Draper the Court of Appeal imposed a lesser sentence than in Burridge in   part  because  as  Mr  Smith  emphasised  some  of  the  aggravating  features  in   Burridge  were  absent  in  that  case,  specifically  that,  in  Burridge,  the                                                                                                                                                                                                             3                                                                                                                                                                                                             defendant’s intention fell just short of what would be the requisite intent for   murder,  that  in  that  case  the  defendant  had  committed  previous  proven  violent  acts  against  the  child,  that  he  had  been  warned  previously  to  seek   help about his bad temper and that he lied to the authorities about his care   of the child. With the possible exception that in this case you have lied about  your  responsibility  until  this  week  I  agree  with  Mr  Smith  that  those     aggravating features in Burridge are equally absent in your case.      13. However,  as  the  Court  of  Appeal  made  clear  in  Draper  the  sentence  of  5  years  imprisonment  was  substituted  on  the  basis  that  the  defendant  was   entitled  to  a  full  one  third  credit  for  his  plea  of  guilty  so  that  sentence   equated to one of 7 and a half years after a full trial. Furthermore, as with all  Attorney General’s references one has to recognise that where the Court of   Appeal increases the sentence it has in mind the principle of double jeopardy   and  imposes  a  lower  sentence  than  would  have  been  imposed  at  trial.   Applying that principle it seems to me Draper should be approached on the   basis that the appropriate sentence by the sentencing judge would have been   8 and a half years following a trial.      14. Whilst I agree with Mr Smith that the aggravating features identified by the   Court  of  Appeal  in  Burridge  are  absent  here  as  they  were  in  Draper,  nonetheless there are aggravating features. As in Draper this is not a case of  a  parent  driven  to  the  end  of  his  tether  by  the  child.  You  were  alone  with   James for no more than ten minutes and so it is difficult to see how that kind  of  end  of  your  tether  situation  could  have  developed  in  that  short  a  time   frame. The reality is that for whatever reason your baby son would not bond   with you and cried whenever he came near you. No doubt that was upsetting   and frustrating but it could hardly be said to be something for which a seven  month old baby could be to blame and Hannah had urged you to be patient    and to persevere, which clearly you did not do.      15. Equally, as in Draper, until the moment earlier this week when you pleaded   guilty  to  manslaughter,  you  have  lied  about  your  responsibility  for  what   happened to your baby son, even to the extent of seeking to attribute to his  mother  the  violence  you  inflicted  on  the  child.  On  any  view  that  is  an   aggravating feature justifying a greater sentence than you would otherwise   receive. Furthermore, although in Draper the defendant sought to explain the  baby’s injuries as attributable to some accident in the baby bouncer as you   have done here, he did not seek to blame the baby’s mother as you did, with  all the agonising consequences for Hannah in this case. That accusation albeit  no  longer  pursued  is  an  additional  aggravating  feature  absent  in  Draper.   Having said that, I accept that this is not a case in which, as in Draper, there  was  some  prior  warning  of  what  might  happen  if  the  child’s  head  hit  the   chair.   16. In sentencing you I take into account everything Mr Smith has said on your   behalf in mitigation, including the genuine remorse you have shown together                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            4      with  your  previous  good  character,  from  which  I  conclude  that  as  the   prosecution fairly accepts, you are not a bad or violent man. I accept also that    this is not a case of an unwanted child but of a child you wanted and loved   and that you had never previously shown violence towards James or towards   your other son.                                                                                                                                                  17. Nonetheless	  as  the  Court  of  Appeal  decisions  to  which  I  have  referred   emphasise the court has to focus on the fact that a victim, here a defenceless   and vulnerable baby who was your own child, has died as a consequence of  your unlawful act. In my judgment if this matter had gone to a trial and the  jury had convicted you of manslaughter the appropriate sentence would have    been one of 8 and a half years imprisonment.     18. Unlike in Draper there is no question of your being entitled to a full credit for    your  plea  of  guilty.  In  the  light  of  the  overwhelming  medical  evidence  that   the injuries suffered by baby James were deliberate and not accidental you  could and should have pleaded guilty at a much earlier stage. You did not in   fact do so until 8 May 2013 the day when the trial was due to start although  ultimately  some  week  and  a  bit  before  the  actual  trial  date.  However,     exceptionally  I  take  into  account  that  the  plea  you  have  entered  has  been      In  the under  consideration  with  Mr  Smith  QC  for  about  a  month.      circumstances you are entitled to more credit than the one tenth you would      normally get for a guilty plea just before the trial. The sentence is one of 7     years imprisonment, so a credit of just under 20 per cent.       19. Of that sentence, you will spend one half in custody, after which you will be   released on licence for the remainder of the sentence. If, during your licence   period  you  commit  any  other  offence  you  are  likely  to  be  returned  to  custody.  The  days  spent  on  remand  will  count  towards  the  sentence.  The   statutory surcharge provisions will apply.                                                                                                                                              5
